DOCUMENT TITLE: Southern California Bight 2003 Regional Monitoring Program: I. Sediment Toxicity; May 19, 2005

NOTE: I did not find categories published per-station, just a method of determine one of three categories.

REFERENCES:

* Executive Summary, Page (v):

Three levels were delineated for assessing sediment toxicity in this study. The first level
was “nontoxic” where amphipod survival was ≥83% relative to controls. The 83% level was based
upon the minimum significant difference approach whereby amphipod survival <83% would be
considered significant in at least 90% of the samples based on replicate variability. The second
level was “moderately toxic” where amphipod survival was ≥50% and < 83% relative to control
survival and was significantly different from controls using standardized t-tests. The third level was
“highly toxic” where amphipod survival was <50% relative to control survival. The 50% level
corresponds to a high probability of degraded benthos based on previous regional monitoring results
from Bight’98.

See the table on this page for classifications. I mistakenly concluded these categories were for the Bight Regional Survey summary data, my mistake.
