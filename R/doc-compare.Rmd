The purpose of `R/main-compare.R` is to generate comparison tables to see any
differences between what `R/main-unify.R` produces versus what is published
already in the SCCWRP data portal.

Each script within compare maps the year's columns to the format that the unify
scripts produce. This way we can sort by `year` and a `status` column, and
related rows should be adjacent for easy comparison.
