The unified summary depends on the package in the SCCWRP/SQOUnified repository.
The code, as-is, assumes it is in a project rooted one level up from this
package.

To run the unified summary generation scripts, there is a centralized main
script `R/main-unify.R`. This will run the summary generation for each specified
year in the main script. If needed, edit the year vector to modify this
behavior. Then run as the following from a shell:

```
Rscript R/main-unify.R
```
