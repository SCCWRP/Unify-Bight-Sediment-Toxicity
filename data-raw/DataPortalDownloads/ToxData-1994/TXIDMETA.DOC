Number of Stations Sampled:  72

Sampling Period:  13 July 1994 -- 22 August 1994

Number Of Variables Measured:  0.  This file contains information describing each of the bioassays 
conducted during the SCBPP.  Toxicity data are in the file TOX_DATA.TXT and the associated water 
quality data are in the file TOX_WQ.TXT.

Sampling Equipment Used:  Sediment for toxicity sampling was collected with a modified, chain-rigged 
0.1m2 Van Veen grab.

Analytical Techniques:  Interstitial water toxicity testing was performed at SCCWRP using embryos of the 
purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, following methods of the EPA’s West Coast Manual.  
Whole sediment testing was performed at SCCWRP and SAIC in Rhode Island.  Whole sediment tests used 
the amphipod Ampelisca abdita by the methods in ASTM, Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Method # E 
1367.

Data Set Verification:  Data set verified by toxicologists from SCCWRP.

General Comments:  This data set contains information pertaining to the set-up of each of the bioassays performed during the 
SCBPP.  Each record has the following fields (variables): QA Batch, Lab Code, Species, Protocol, Test 
date, Phase/TestMaterial, Test duration, Temperature and TestAccept.

QA Batch is the internal experiment designation by either SCCWRP or SAIC.

Lab Code is the 5 letter code for the laboratory that performed the bioassay either CASCC for SCCWRP or 
RISAI for SAIC in Rhode Island.

Species is for test species, either SP for Strongylocentrotus purpuratus or AB for Ampelisca.

Protocol is the guidance document that was used to perform the bioassay.

Test date is the date that the bioassay was initiated.

Phase/TestMaterial is the type of sample that was tested.  This will either be SP for solid phase (whole 
sediment) or WP for water phase (interstitial water).

Test duration is the length of time (in days) that the exposure was carried out.

Temperature is the average temperature (in degrees C) during the exposure period.

Test Accept is a letter designation for deviations from the QA parameters set forth for the project.  More 
than one letter may be present for any given record:
	A       All QA criteria met
	C       Reduced number of replicates
	E       One or more samples stored greater than 30 days
	G       Reference test missing or outside limits
	H       Water quality data incomplete
	J       Minor deviation in test conditions

Station locations can be found in the Benthic Master Sample File.  Descriptive data on sediment color and 
texture and depth of penetration of the grab are available from SCCWRP on request.

Field and Laboratory Techniques:  Sediment for toxicity analysis was collected with a modified 0.1m2 Van 
Veen grab.  A minimum of three liter of surface (top 2 cm) sediment was collected from each station.  
Sediment was stored in one liter polyethylene jars at 3-5  C for up to four weeks.  For the amphipod tests, 
sediment was homogenized by hand then passed through 1 mm screen for samples tested at SCCWRP or 2 
mm screen for samples tested at SAIC.  A 2 cm layer of sediment was added to quart-sized canning jars 
with 600 ml of 30 g/kg seawater on top.  Five replicates from each station were tested.  Twenty amphipods 
were added the next day and test was carried out for 10 days at 20  C, with survival as the endpoint.  
Interstitial water was obtained by centrifuging approximately 400 ml of homogenized, unscreened 
sediment at 3,000 x g for 30 min.  Sample with pH less than 7.5 were adjusted to 7.6-8.0.  Three 
concentrations of interstitial water (100, 50 and 25%) were prepared if sufficient sample volume was 
available.  Three replicates of each concentration were tested.  Purple sea urchin embryos were added to 
the interstitial water and allowed to develop for 72 h at 15  C.  Embryo samples were then preserved and 
examined microscopically for normal development.

Quality Assurance And Quality Control Evaluation:  Most of the tests met the QA criteria set forth in the 
SCBPP Quality Assurance Plan.  One amphipod survival test failed to meet the criteria and retesting of 
these samples resulted in several samples being stored greater than 30 days and having less than 5 
replicates.  An amphipod test was not performed for station 245 due to not enough sample volume.  Some 
concentrations of interstitial water were not done because of insufficient sample volume.  Many of the 
interstitial water samples have reduced numbers of replicates.  This reduced replication was due to a 
decision not microscopically evaluate all replicates of any concentration if a higher concentration of the 
same sample was found to be 0% normal.
	Reference toxicant test for both the urchin and amphipod tests indicated that the animals were 
within expected sensitivity ranges for all experiments.  An interlaboratory comparison of 16 whole 
sediment samples between SCCWRP and SAIC showed good agreement.

Data Use and Comparability:  The data in this file are strictly for use in evaluating the bioassay test 
conditions for exposures conducted during the SCBPP.  Data can be used for evaluating conditions both 
between tests and between laboratories.
