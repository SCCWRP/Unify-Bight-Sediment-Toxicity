Number of Stations Sampled:  72

Sampling Period:  13 July 1994 -- 22 August 1994

Number Of Variables Measured:  2:  Interstitial water toxicity measured as number of normal embryos and 
whole sediment toxicity measured as number of surviving amphipods.  Water quality data from the 
exposures appears in the file TOX_WQ.TXT.  Since the interstitial water tests were affected by 
interference from ammonia, data from interstitial water tests should not be used without consideration of 
this factor.  See "Data Use and Comparability" for more information.

Sampling Equipment Used:  Sediment for toxicity sampling was collected with a modified, chain-rigged 
0.1m2 Van Veen grab.

Analytical Techniques:  Interstitial water toxicity testing was performed at SCCWRP using embryos of the 
purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, following methods of the EPA’s West Coast Manual.  
Whole sediment testing was performed at SCCWRP and SAIC in Rhode Island.  Whole sediment tests used 
the amphipod, Ampelisca abdita, by the methods in ASTM.

Data Set Verification:  Data set verified by toxicologists from SCCWRP.

General Comments:
	       This data set includes number of embryos counted and number normal for interstitial water tests 
and the starting number of amphipods and number surviving for the whole sediment tests.  Each record has 
the following fields (variables):  Log Number, QA Batch, Species, Phase, Dilution, ControlCode, Endpoint, 
Lab Rep, Start Count, Value, QA Code, and Lab Code.  The log number is a 10 digit code in the following 
form:
					  Digit
					     1             -            P for Pilot Project
					   2 & 3           -            Agency collecting the sediment
					   4 & 5           -            Type of data (ST = Sediment toxicity)
					   6 to 9          -            Station number
					     10            -            Replicate number

For agency collecting sediment, EC = Control sediment collected by SCCWRP’s amphipod supplier; SA = 
Control sediment collected by SAIC in Rhode Island;  SC= Centrifugation blank created in the SCCWRP 
laboratory;  HY= Hyperion Treatment Plant;  LA= County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County;  
ME= MEC Analytical Systems, Inc. and SD= City of San Diego.  The replicate digit will be 0 in all cases 
except when a sample has been split between SCCWRP and SAIC for toxicity testing.  In those cases, the 
replicate value is 0 for the sample tested by SCCWRP and 1 for the sample tested by SAIC.

QA Batch is the internal experiment designation by either SCCWRP or SAIC.

Species is for test species, either SP for Strongylocentrotus purpuratus or AB for Ampelisca abdita.

Phase is for phase of sediment tested, either SP for solid phase (whole sediment) or WP for water phase 
(interstitial water).

Dilution is percentage of sample that was interstitial water.  Null indicates 100% sample.  All whole 
sediment tests were 100% whole sediment.

ControlCode is the log number of the control sample associated with the particular record.

Endpoint is the measured endpoint for the record, either NN for number normal in embryo tests or NA for 
number alive in amphipod tests.

Lab Rep is the replicate number for the particular record.

Start Count is either the total number of embryos counted for the urchin test or the number of amphipods 
added to the beaker at the start of a whole sediment test.

Value is either the number of normal embryos for the urchin test or the number of surviving amphipods for 
that test.

QA Code is a letter designation for deviations from the QA parameters set forth for the project.  More than 
one letter may be present for any given record:
	A       All QA criteria met
	C       Reduced number of replicates
	D       Control performance criteria not met
	E       Sample stored greater than 30 days
	J       Minor deviation in test conditions
	N       Endpoint not evaluated for this record

Lab Code is the 5 letter code for the laboratory that performed the bioassay.  Either CASCC for SCCWRP 
or RISAI for SAIC in Rhode Island.

Station locations can be found in the Benthic Master Sample File, except for the following three control 
sites.  All log numbers having the EC agency code, except station 3002, were a negative control station 
where the amphipods were collected in Rhode Island (lat:41.443889, long:71.456944).  Station 3002 was a 
postitive control site for the amphipod test.  This station was located in Wickford Harbor, Rhode Island 
(lat:41.582222,long:71.425).  All stations with the SA agency code were for the negative control station 
used by SAIC for there amphipod tests.  This station is located in Long Island Sound (lat:41.1325, 
long:72.87833).  Descriptive data on sediment color and texture and depth of penetration of the grab for 
SCBPP stations are available from SCCWRP on request.

Field and Laboratory Techniques:  Sediment for toxicity analysis was collected with a modified 0.1m2 Van 
Veen grab.  A minimum of three liters of surface (top 2 cm) sediment was collected from each station.  
Sediment was stored in one liter polyethylene jars at 3-5  C for up to four weeks.  For the amphipod tests, 
sediment was homogenized by hand then passed through 1 mm screen for samples tested at SCCWRP or 2 
mm screen for samples tested at SAIC.  A 2 cm layer of sediment was added to quart-sized canning jars 
with 600 ml of 30 g/kg seawater on top.  Five replicates from each station were tested.  Twenty amphipods 
were added the next day and the test was carried out for 10 days at 20  C, with survival as the endpoint.  
Interstitial water was obtained by centrifuging approximately 400 ml of homogenized, unscreened 
sediment at 3,000 x g for 30 min.  Samples with pH less than 7.5 were adjusted to 7.6-8.0.  Three 
concentrations of interstitial water (100, 50 and 25%) were prepared if sufficient sample volume was 
available.  Three replicates of each concentration were tested.  Purple sea urchin embryos were added to 
the interstitial water and allowed to develop for 72 h at 15  C.  Embryo samples were then preserved and 
examined microscopically for normal development.

Quality Assurance And Quality Control Evaluation:  Most of the tests met the QA criteria set forth in the 
SCBPP Quality Assurance Plan.  One amphipod survival test failed to meet the criteria and retesting of 
these samples resulted in several samples being stored greater than 30 days and having less than 5 
replicates.  An amphipod test was not performed for station 245 due to not enough sample volume.  Some 
concentrations of interstitial water were not done because of insufficient sample volume.  Many of the 
interstitial water samples have reduced numbers of replicates.  Reduced replication resulted when the lower 
concentrations exhibited complete toxicity (0% normal).  When lower concentrations exhibited complete 
toxicity, only one replicate of the higher concentration was examined microscopically to confirm toxicity.
	Reference toxicant tests for both the urchin and amphipod bioassays indicated that the animals 
were within expected sensitivity ranges for all experiments.  For 16 of the stations, splits of the whole 
sediment were made and amphipod tests were performed by both SCCWRP and SAIC.  Both sets of data 
appear in the file and there is good agreement between the results.

Data Use and Comparability:  The data are appropriate for the comparison between stations at the time of 
sampling.  The data are appropriate for the use with other data collected during the SCBPP.
	For comparison of data between different bioassays within the SCBPP toxicity data set, the data 
should be normalized to the control values.
	For the interstitial water data, there was an interference by ammonia.  Ammonia levels were found 
to have increased greatly during storage of the sediments and led to many samples appearing to be more 
toxic than would have been expected if no ammonia was present.  SCCWRP has processed the data to 
remove the ammonia interference.  After processing, each station was designated as toxic, non-toxic or 
indeterminate.  That information appears in the file TOX_TOX.TXT.
