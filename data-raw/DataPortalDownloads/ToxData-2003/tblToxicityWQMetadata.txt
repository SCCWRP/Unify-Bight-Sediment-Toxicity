  Description:
    Abstract:
      The Southern California Bight (SCB; Figure I-1),
      an open embayment in the coast between Point
      Conception and Cape Colnett (south of Ensenada),
      Baja California, is an important and unique
      ecological resource.  The SCB is a transitional
      area that is influenced by currents from cold,
      temperate ocean waters from the north and warm,
      tropical waters from the south.  In addition, the
      SCB has a complex topography, with offshore
      islands, submarine canyons, ridges and basins,
      which provide a variety of habitats.  The mixing
      of currents and the diverse habitats in the SCB
      allow for the coexistence of a broad spectrum of
      species, including more than 500 species of fish
      and several thousand species of invertebrates.
      The SCB is also a major migration route, with
      marine bird and mammal populations ranking among
      the most diverse in north temperate waters.  The
      coastal zone of the SCB is a substantial economic
      resource.  Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbor is the
      largest commercial port in the United States, and
      San Diego Harbor is home to one of the largest US
      Naval facilities in the country.  More than 100
      million people visit southern California beaches
      and coastal areas annually, bringing an estimated
      $9B into the economy.  Recreational activities
      include diving, swimming, surfing, and boating,
      with about 40,000 pleasure boats docked in 13
      coastal marinas within the region (NRC 1990).
      Recreational fishing brings in more than $500M per
      year.  The SCB is one of the most densely
      populated coastal regions in the country, which
      creates stress upon its marine environment.
      Nearly 20 million people inhabit coastal Southern
      California, a number that is expected to increase
      another 20% by 2010 (NRC 1990).  Population growth
      generally results in conversion of open land into
      non-permeable surfaces.  More than 75% of southern
      Californian bays and estuaries have already been
      dredged and filled for conversion into harbors and
      marinas (Horn and Allen 1985).  This “hardening of
      the coast” increases the rate of runoff and can
      impact water quality through addition of sediment,
      toxic chemicals, pathogens and nutrients to the
      ocean.  Besides the impacts of land conversion,
      the SCB is already home to fifteen municipal
      wastewater treatment facilities, eight power
      generating stations, 10 industrial treatment
      facilities, and 18 oil platforms that discharge to
      the open coast.  Each year, local, state, and
      federal agencies spend in excess of $31M to
      monitor the environmental quality of natural
      resources in the SCB (Schiff et al 2001).  At
      least 75% of this monitoring is associated with
      National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
      (NPDES) permits and is intended to assess
      compliance of waste discharge with the California
      Ocean Plan and the federal Clean Water Act, which
      set water quality standards for effluent and
      receiving waters.  Some of this information has
      played a significant role in management decisions
      in the SCB.  While these monitoring programs have
      provided important information, they were designed
      to evaluate impacts near individual discharges.
      Today, resource managers are being encouraged to
      develop management strategies for the entire SCB.
      To accomplish this task, they need
      regionally-based information to assess cumulative
      impacts of contaminant inputs and to evaluate
      relative risk among different types of stresses.
      It is difficult to use existing data to evaluate
      regional issues because the monitoring was
      designed to be site-specific and is limited to
      specific geographic areas.  The monitoring
      provides substantial data for some areas, but
      there is little or no data for the areas in
      between.  Beyond the spatial limitations, data
      from these programs are not easily merged to
      examine relative risk.  The parameters measured
      often differ among programs.  Even when the same
      parameters are measured, the methodologies used to
      collect the data often differ and interlaboratory
      quality assurance (QA) exercises to assess data
      comparability are rare.  Previous Regional
      Monitoring Studies  To begin addressing these
      concerns, there have been two previous regional
      monitoring efforts.  The first regional monitoring
      survey in 1994, called the Southern California
      Bight Pilot Project (SCBPP), was a compilation of
      12 agencies that cooperatively sampled 261 sites
      along the continental shelf between Point
      Conception and the United States/Mexico border.
      The second regional monitoring survey, called the
      Southern California Bight 1998 Regional Monitoring
      Project (Bight’98), was comprised of 64 agencies
      that cooperatively sampled 416 sites between Point
      Conception and Punta Banda, Mexico.  In both
      surveys, assessments were made of water quality,
      sediment contamination, the status of biological
      resources and species diversity, and the presence
      of marine debris in depths of 10 to 200m, with
      some special emphasis in areas of anthropogenic
      inputs such as large publicly owned treatment
      works (POTWs) or large river and creek mouths.
      However, Bight’98 extended what was done in 1994
      by adding additional habitats such as offshore
      islands and inshore areas like bays/harbors, as
      well as additional areas of anthropogenic inputs
      such as marinas, ports, and small POTWs.
      Moreover, a regional evaluation of shoreline water
      quality was added in 1998 that provided our first
      evaluation of the swimmability of southern
      California beaches during dry and wet weather.
      Benefits derived from both the SCBPP and Bight’98
      also included the development of new useful
      technical tools that could only be developed with
      regional data sets and participation by multiple
      organizations.   For example, the project produced
      iron-normalization curves for the SCB, allowing
      distinction between natural and anthropogenic
      contributions of metals in sediments (Schiff and
      Weisberg 1998).  A Benthic Response Index was
      developed that integrates complex benthic infaunal
      data into an easily interpreted form that
      describes the degree of perturbation at a site
      (Bergen et al. 1998).  Newer, cheaper
      microbiological methods were tested and evaluated
      alongside traditional microbial measurement
      methods and now have been accepted by both the
      state health agencies for routine shoreline
      monitoring (ref).  Bight’98 also improved the
      comparability among the major laboratories in the
      SCB as a result of the quality assurance and
      quality control (QA/QC) laboratory
      intercalibration exercises for chemistry and
      microbiology.  The project also produced a series
      of manuals containing standardized field,
      laboratory and data management activities that
      increased continuity of data and data reporting
      among participants, even after the regional
      monitoring surveys were completed.  2003 Survey
      The proposed Southern California Bight 2003
      Regional Monitoring Project (Bight’03) is a
      continuation of the successful cooperative
      regional-scale monitoring begun in southern
      California during the 1990’s.  Bight’03 builds
      upon the previous successes and expands on the
      1998 survey by including new participants,
      sampling more habitats, and measuring more
      parameters or using new methods.  [Number]
      organizations, including international and
      volunteer organizations, have agreed to
      participate (Table I-1).  The inclusion of
      multiple participants, many of them new to
      regional monitoring, provides several benefits.
      Cooperative interactions among many organizations
      with different perspectives and interests,
      including a combination of regulators and
      dischargers, ensures that an appropriate set of
      regional-scale questions will be addressed by the
      study.  The additional resources brought by
      numerous participants also expands the number of
      habitats and indicators that will be sampled.
      Sampling for Bight’03 will include all of the
      areas sampled in 1998, plus a new focus on
      nearshore habitats (coastal lagoons) and offshore
      habitats (inner continental slopes and basins).
      Several new technologies will be brought to bear
      in Bight’03 including remote sensing from
      satellite, aerial, and land-based platforms, new
      microbial genetic and phenotypic source tracking
      techniques, and radiodating of sediments to
      determine age and accumulation of chemicals in
      sediments.
    Purpose:
      The goal of this study was to answer two
      questions: 1) What percent of area in the SCB
      contains sediments toxic to marine organisms?; and
      2) How does sediment toxicity compare among
      specific areas of interest?  The batch information
      file provides data on the conduct of individual
      test batches, such as laboratory, date and quality
      assurance information.

      Sediment toxicity:  Toxicity tests provide a
      direct measure of the effect of contamination on
      benthic organisms.  These tests complement
      sediment chemistry measurements by providing a
      measure of the combined toxic effect of the
      complex mixture of contaminants present in
      sediment or in the water in the pores between
      sediment grains (interstitial water).  Sediment
      samples will be collected from the top 2 cm of a
      Van Veen grab sample.  The toxicity of bulk
      sediments will be assessed using an amphipod
      survival test conducted according to USEPA
      methods.  Amphipods will be exposed to a 2 cm
      layer of test sediment for 10 days and then
      examined to determine the percent survival.  The
      amphipod Eohaustorius estuarius was selected for
      this study because of its wide tolerance to
      variations in habitat characteristics and to
      provide comparability with recent toxicity
      information from other monitoring programs in
      California.

      Methodology_Description:
        VII.   SEDIMENT TOXICITY TESTING A.   Overview
        This section describes QA/QC procedures that will
        be used for the assessment of sediment toxicity
        during the Bight’03 Survey.  Only one toxicity
        test will be used for assessment of the sediment.
        The toxicity of whole sediment will be measured
        using an amphipod (Eohaustorius estuarius)
        survival test.   B.   Laboratory Capability
        Prior to participating in the Bight 03 survey,
        the test laboratory must document their ability to
        conduct the tests with the selected test species.
        This should consist of a record of at least three
        prior tests in which test acceptability was
        attained.  In addition, the laboratory should have
        conducted at least three prior reference toxicant
        tests so that a control chart can be constructed.
        A written description of the test method used must
        also be provided to the Steering Committee prior
        to the analysis of samples.   C.   Interlaboratory
        Comparability  	All laboratories conducting the
        amphipod survival tests must participate in an
        interlaboratory comparison exercise prior to
        sample testing.  This exercise will include the
        analysis of field collected sediments and a
        reference toxicant test.  Successful completion of
        this exercise by a laboratory will be evaluated
        using two criteria: 1) attainment of test
        acceptability criteria, and 2) agreement of
        results between laboratories.  The criteria for
        establishing agreement of results will be
        determined by the Toxicology Committee.
        Laboratories unable to successfully complete the
        interlaboratory comparison exercise will be asked
        to examine their test procedures, make suggested
        changes, and retest the comparison samples.
        Failure to meet the interlaboratory comparison
        criteria will result in the addition of a
        cautionary data qualifier flag to that
        laboratory’s data.  	In additon to the
        intercalibration before sample testing, additonal
        split samples will be tested by the laboratories
        during the project.  These samples will be used to
        verify that the results remain comparable during
        the course of testing.  The results of these
        additional samples will be for informational
        purposes only.  D.   Sample Collection  	Methods
        for collection of sediment are described in the
        Field Operations Manual.  Surface sediment (top 2
        cm) will be collected from Van Veen grabs and
        stored in precleaned polyethylene jars.  Samples
        may be stored in the dark at 4 ?C  for up to two
        weeks before testing.  Sediment samples should be
        press sieved through a 2 mm screen and homogenized
        in the laboratory before testing.  	All samples
        shall be accompanied by chain of custody and
        sample tracking forms.  These forms should include
        dates of receipt, homogenization, and testing of
        each sample, as well as storage conditions.  E.
        Amphipod Survival Test  	An amphipod survival test
        will be conducted according to (EPA 1994)
        guidelines.  This test consists of a 10-day
        exposure of Eohaustorius estuarius to sediment
        under static conditions.  Amphipods are placed in
        glass chambers containing seawater and a 2 cm
        layer of test sediment.  The number of surviving
        amphipods is measured at the end of the test and
        used to calculate the percentage survival.
        Quality of test organisms  	All test organisms
        will be obtained from a common source during the
        survey.  Species identification should be verified
        through consultation with a taxonomist, if
        necessary.  Individuals selected for testing
        should be visually inspected to confirm that they
        are the proper size and in good condition (i.e.,
        no external damage).  Holding time prior to
        testing should be 10 days or less.  Accuracy and
        precision  	The accuracy of sediment toxicity
        tests of field samples cannot be determined since
        a reference material of known toxicity is not
        available.  A reference toxicant test will be run
        with every batch of test samples in order to
        document amphipod relative sensitivity and test
        precision. This test will consist of a 96-hour
        exposure to five different concentrations of
        cadmium dissolved in seawater.  Cadmium
        concentrations will be selected to provide an
        estimate of the LC50 and will be verified by
        chemical analysis of one of the exposure
        treatments (e.g., the median test concentration).
        Reference toxicant test results that fall outside
        of control chart limits (2 sd of mean) will
        trigger a review of test procedures and a possible
        retest of the corresponding sediment samples.
        Test conditions  	Water quality of the overlying
        water and pore water will be measured for each
        sample type at the beginning and end of the
        exposure.  Temperature will be measured
        continuously in the exposure room.  Instruments
        will be calibrated daily.  Deviations in water
        quality will be noted on the data files.
        Interference by ammonia  	The presence of high
        concentrations of ammonia in pore water may be a
        confounding factor for sediment toxicity tests
        with Eohaustorius.  Laboratories will be required
        to measure the concentration of un-ionized ammonia
        in the pore water from each station, prior to the
        start of toxicity testing.  If the pore water
        concentration exceeds the limit of 0.8 mg/L
        un-ionized ammonia for any station within a batch,
        the laboratory will be required to perform a
        similtaneous ammonia reference toxicant test along
        with that batch.  The results of the ammonia
        reference toxicant testing will be compared to the
        concentrations of ammonia in the test samples to
        determine if the levels are high enough to account
        for any observed toxicity in the sediment samples.
        Test acceptability 	 	This toxicity test
        procedure is considered unacceptable if amphipod
        survival in "home sediment" is less than 90%, or
        if survival in any control replicate is less than
        80%.  Reference toxicant results must also be
        within two standard deviations of the mean
        response specific to the laboratory.  Water
        quality parameters (salinity, temperature, pH, and
        ammonia) should also be within the tolerance range
        of the test organism, as specified in EPA (1994)
        guidance.    	A sediment holding time of no more
        than two weeks has been established in order to
        minimize the potential alteration of the  sediment
        toxicity due to storage; this time period is not a
        criterion for judging test acceptability.  Tests
        on samples that are stored from greater than two
        weeks up to four weeks will also be considered
        valid, but a data qualifier will be attached to
        the record to indicate that the desired storage
        time was been exceeded.   Samples stored for more
        than four weeks before the start of toxicity
        testing will be considered unacceptable for
        testing and the data will not be included in the
        project database.
