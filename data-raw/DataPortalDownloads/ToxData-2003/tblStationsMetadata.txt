  Description:
    Abstract:
      The Southern California Bight , an open embayment
      in the coast between Point Conception and Cape
      Colnett (south of Ensenada), Baja California, is
      an important and unique ecological resource.  The
      SCB is a transitional area that is influenced by
      currents from cold, temperate ocean waters from
      the north and warm, tropical waters from the
      south.  In addition, the SCB has a complex
      topography, with offshore islands, submarine
      canyons, ridges and basins, which provide a
      variety of habitats.  The mixing of currents and
      the diverse habitats in the SCB allow for the
      coexistence of a broad spectrum of species,
      including more than 500 species of fish and
      several thousand species of invertebrates.  The
      SCB is also a major migration route, with marine
      bird and mammal populations ranking among the most
      diverse in north temperate waters.  The coastal
      zone of the SCB is a substantial economic
      resource.  Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbor is the
      largest commercial port in the United States, and
      San Diego Harbor is home to one of the largest US
      Naval facilities in the country.  More than 100
      million people visit southern California beaches
      and coastal areas annually, bringing an estimated
      $9B into the economy.  Recreational activities
      include diving, swimming, surfing, and boating,
      with about 40,000 pleasure boats docked in 13
      coastal marinas within the region (NRC 1990).
      Recreational fishing brings in more than $500M per
      year.  The SCB is one of the most densely
      populated coastal regions in the country, which
      creates stress upon its marine environment.
      Nearly 20 million people inhabit coastal Southern
      California, a number that is expected to increase
      another 20% by 2010 (NRC 1990).  Population growth
      generally results in conversion of open land into
      non-permeable surfaces.  More than 75% of southern
      Californian bays and estuaries have already been
      dredged and filled for conversion into harbors and
      marinas (Horn and Allen 1985).  This “hardening of
      the coast” increases the rate of runoff and can
      impact water quality through addition of sediment,
      toxic chemicals, pathogens and nutrients to the
      ocean.  Besides the impacts of land conversion,
      the SCB is already home to fifteen municipal
      wastewater treatment facilities, eight power
      generating stations, 10 industrial treatment
      facilities, and 18 oil platforms that discharge to
      the open coast.  Each year, local, state, and
      federal agencies spend in excess of $31M to
      monitor the environmental quality of natural
      resources in the SCB (Schiff et al 2001).  At
      least 75% of this monitoring is associated with
      National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
      (NPDES) permits and is intended to assess
      compliance of waste discharge with the California
      Ocean Plan and the federal Clean Water Act, which
      set water quality standards for effluent and
      receiving waters.  Some of this information has
      played a significant role in management decisions
      in the SCB.  While these monitoring programs have
      provided important information, they were designed
      to evaluate impacts near individual discharges.
      Today, resource managers are being encouraged to
      develop management strategies for the entire SCB.
      To accomplish this task, they need
      regionally-based information to assess cumulative
      impacts of contaminant inputs and to evaluate
      relative risk among different types of stresses.
      It is difficult to use existing data to evaluate
      regional issues because the monitoring was
      designed to be site-specific and is limited to
      specific geographic areas.  The monitoring
      provides substantial data for some areas, but
      there is little or no data for the areas in
      between.  Beyond the spatial limitations, data
      from these programs are not easily merged to
      examine relative risk.  The parameters measured
      often differ among programs.  Even when the same
      parameters are measured, the methodologies used to
      collect the data often differ and interlaboratory
      quality assurance (QA) exercises to assess data
      comparability are rare.  Previous Regional
      Monitoring Studies  To begin addressing these
      concerns, there have been two previous regional
      monitoring efforts.  The first regional monitoring
      survey in 1994, called the Southern California
      Bight Pilot Project (SCBPP), was a compilation of
      12 agencies that cooperatively sampled 261 sites
      along the continental shelf between Point
      Conception and the United States/Mexico border.
      The second regional monitoring survey, called the
      Southern California Bight 1998 Regional Monitoring
      Project (Bight’98), was comprised of 64 agencies
      that cooperatively sampled 416 sites between Point
      Conception and Punta Banda, Mexico.  In both
      surveys, assessments were made of water quality,
      sediment contamination, the status of biological
      resources and species diversity, and the presence
      of marine debris in depths of 10 to 200m, with
      some special emphasis in areas of anthropogenic
      inputs such as large publicly owned treatment
      works (POTWs) or large river and creek mouths.
      However, Bight’98 extended what was done in 1994
      by adding additional habitats such as offshore
      islands and inshore areas like bays/harbors, as
      well as additional areas of anthropogenic inputs
      such as marinas, ports, and small POTWs.
      Moreover, a regional evaluation of shoreline water
      quality was added in 1998 that provided our first
      evaluation of the swimmability of southern
      California beaches during dry and wet weather.
      Benefits derived from both the SCBPP and Bight’98
      also included the development of new useful
      technical tools that could only be developed with
      regional data sets and participation by multiple
      organizations.   For example, the project produced
      iron-normalization curves for the SCB, allowing
      distinction between natural and anthropogenic
      contributions of metals in sediments (Schiff and
      Weisberg 1998).  A Benthic Response Index was
      developed that integrates complex benthic infaunal
      data into an easily interpreted form that
      describes the degree of perturbation at a site
      (Bergen et al. 1998).  Newer, cheaper
      microbiological methods were tested and evaluated
      alongside traditional microbial measurement
      methods and now have been accepted by both the
      state health agencies for routine shoreline
      monitoring (ref).  Bight’98 also improved the
      comparability among the major laboratories in the
      SCB as a result of the quality assurance and
      quality control (QA/QC) laboratory
      intercalibration exercises for chemistry and
      microbiology.  The project also produced a series
      of manuals containing standardized field,
      laboratory and data management activities that
      increased continuity of data and data reporting
      among participants, even after the regional
      monitoring surveys were completed.  2003 Survey
      The proposed Southern California Bight 2003
      Regional Monitoring Project (Bight’03) is a
      continuation of the successful cooperative
      regional-scale monitoring begun in southern
      California during the 1990’s.  Bight’03 builds
      upon the previous successes and expands on the
      1998 survey by including new participants,
      sampling more habitats, and measuring more
      parameters or using new methods.  [Number]
      organizations, including international and
      volunteer organizations, have agreed to
      participate (Table I-1).  The inclusion of
      multiple participants, many of them new to
      regional monitoring, provides several benefits.
      Cooperative interactions among many organizations
      with different perspectives and interests,
      including a combination of regulators and
      dischargers, ensures that an appropriate set of
      regional-scale questions will be addressed by the
      study.  The additional resources brought by
      numerous participants also expands the number of
      habitats and indicators that will be sampled.
      Sampling for Bight’03 will include all of the
      areas sampled in 1998, plus a new focus on
      nearshore habitats (coastal lagoons) and offshore
      habitats (inner continental slopes and basins).
      Several new technologies will be brought to bear
      in Bight’03 including remote sensing from
      satellite, aerial, and land-based platforms, new
      microbial genetic and phenotypic source tracking
      techniques, and radiodating of sediments to
      determine age and accumulation of chemicals in
      sediments.
    Purpose:
      The overall goal of the coastal ecology component
      of Bight’03 is to assess the condition of the
      bottom environment and the health of the
      biological resources in the SCB.  To accomplish
      this goal, Bight’03 will focus on two primary
      objectives:      1.Estimate the extent and
      magnitude of ecological change in the SCB,
      2.Determine the mass balance of pollutants that
      currently reside within the SCB.  The first
      objective, estimating the amount of area (i.e.,
      number of acres) in the SCB that ecological
      conditions differ from reference conditions, is a
      departure from traditional approaches to
      environmental monitoring, which generally focus on
      estimating average condition.  Estimating the
      areal extent of ecological change offers several
      advantages.  First, it provides a more direct
      assessment of status.  For instance, identifying
      that the average concentration of dissolved oxygen
      in the Bight is 6.7 ppm provides less useful
      information for environmental managers than does
      identifying what percentage of the area in the
      Bight fails to meet water quality standards.  A
      second advantage of estimating areal extent
      concerns trend detection.  If conditions in the
      Bight change over time such that some areas
      improve and others worsen, the average condition
      might not change.  By estimating the areal extent
      of alteration, we will be better able to describe
      these changes.  There are two subobjectives within
      the areal extent and magnitude objective.  The
      first subobjective is to determine if the areal
      extent and magnitude vary among geographic
      regions. If we answer this question, then managers
      can determine if specific areas are in worse
      condition than others, such as areas near
      anthropogenic inputs versus those areas distant
      from inputs.  Therefore, Bight’03 will compare
      condition among 11 geographic areas of interest
      (Table II-1).  These subpopulations of our study
      area were selected to represent a range of natural
      and potentially affected habitats, and include all
      of the habitats sampled in 1998.  There are three
      new habitats to be sampled in Bight’03.  The first
      two are located offshore of previously sampled
      habitats; the upper continental slope (200-500m)
      and the lower slope and inner basin (500-1000m).
      The break in deep water strata is a reflection of
      an ecotone between upper slope and lower slope
      biological communities.  The third habitat is
      inshore of previous sampled habitats and includes
      coastal lagoons.  Comparison of the relative
      condition among strata not only provides
      information about the geographic distribution of
      impacts, it also allows comparison of relative
      risk from a variety of point and non-point source
      discharges.  Comparison of conditions may be
      conducted by comparing the extent of area
      exceeding a threshold of concern or by comparison
      of mean condition.  The second subobjective within
      the areal extent and magnitude objective is
      assessing the relationship between biological
      responses and contaminant exposure. Such
      associations provide the information necessary for
      risk assessment, and for developing efficient
      regional strategies for protecting the environment
      by identifying the predominant types of stress in
      the SCB ecosystem.  Therefore, this subobjective
      will be accomplished by simultaneously collecting
      numerous measures of biological response,
      contaminant exposure and habitat condition (Table
      II-2) to better identify when exposure has reached
      a level of concern.  Measuring multiple indicators
      also permits us to identify the most likely type
      of exposure leading to biological response.  The
      second primary objective will create a mass
      balance of contaminants in the SCB.  This
      objective recognizes that local monitoring
      programs only address a portion of what is
      discharged to the SCB and that contaminant inputs
      to the SCB are cumulative both among sources and
      over time.  Ultimately, both environmental
      managers and the public want to know what fraction
      of the contaminants that are discharged remain in
      the SCB and what fraction leaves the SCB.
      Therefore, Bight’03 will create an inventory of
      contaminants that reside in the SCB in sediment,
      water column, and biological compartments.  The
      total mass of contaminants in these compartments
      will be compared to estimates of mass discharged
      from land based activities.  Understanding how
      much mass is in the SCB will require some new
      measurements including measurements of not just
      sediment chemistry, but estimates of accumulation
      rates in sediments, as well as new measurements in
      the water column.
