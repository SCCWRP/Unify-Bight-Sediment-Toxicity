              Title: Bight'98 Overview
  Description:
    Abstract:
      Sediment from 303 sites on the continental shelf
      between Point Conception, California, and the
      United States-Mexico international border were
      sampled between July 13 and September 16, 1998.
      Sites were selected using a stratified random
      design.  Five of the strata were located offshore
      (river mouths, large publicly owned treatment
      works [POTW] discharge areas, small POTW discharge
      areas, remaining shallow areas [5-30 m], and
      remaining mid-depth areas [30-120 m]).  Three
      additional strata were located within bays and
      harbors, which included marinas, ports/industrial
      areas, and other harbor areas.    Subsets of the
      sediment samples were evaluated for toxicity using
      up to four methods.  Bulk sediment from 241
      stations was measured for toxicity using a 10-d
      amphipod (Eohaustorius estuarius) survival test.
      Sediment extracts from 268 stations were evaluated
      for toxicity using the P450 human reporter gene
      system (HRGS) test, which measures the
      concentration of organic compounds that induce the
      cytochrome P450 enzyme system (e.g., PAHs,
      dioxins, furans, and some PCBs).  Elutriates from
      173 samples were tested for sublethal toxicity
      (bioluminescence inhibition) to phytoplankton
      (Gonyaulax polyedra) using the QwikSed test.
      Interstitial water from 88 samples was analyzed
      for sublethal toxicity (bioluminescence
      inhibition) to the marine bacterium, Vibrio
      fischeri (Microtox test).  Seven laboratories
      conducted the amphipod survival tests.    The
      amphipod test detected toxicity in each of the
      seven strata.  Amphipod toxicity was most
      prevalent in bay and harbor areas, where 13-37% of
      the area (depending upon the stratum) was toxic.
      Toxicity was least prevalent in POTW outfall areas
      (6% of the area) and the shallow portion of the
      coastal shelf (3% of the area).  Each of the other
      tests also detected sediment toxicity in selected
      strata.  The QwikSed test was the most sensitive
      of the toxicity indicators.  Toxicity using
      QwikSed was detected in elutriate samples from
      bays and harbors and also from POTW outfall areas.
      HRGS gene activity was induced by sediment
      extracts from 30 stations, with most of the
      induction produced by samples from port/industrial
      or marina areas.  Microtox measurements of
      interstitial water were taken but were unsuitable
      for use because of changes in toxicity related to
      prolonged sample storage.  The Microtox test data
      were not used for the assessment of sediment
      quality.    Sediment toxicity is just one of three
      types of information needed to assess coastal
      sediment quality.  Measures of sediment
      contamination and biological response (e.g.,
      benthic community impacts) are also needed to
      establish whether the toxicity patterns are
      ecologically significant and associated with
      anthropogenic inputs.
    Purpose:
      The sediment toxicity component of the 1998
      Southern California Bight Regional Monitoring
      Project (Bight'98) had three goals: (1) to
      determine the percent of area in the SCB that
      contains sediments toxic to marine organisms; (2)
      to compare the responses among sediment toxicity
      test methods; and (3) to evaluate the relationship
      between sediment toxicity and chemical
      contamination or changes in benthic communities.
    Supplemental_Information:
      This database contains information for quality
      assurance samples (e.g. blanks and reference
      toxicants) as well as sediment samples.  In
      addition, repeated analyses (at a later date) are
      included for some QwikSed samples where the
      initial readings did not meet QA objectives.
      These types of samples are identified in the QA
      code and comment fields accompanying each record
      and may need to be removed from the file prior to
      statistical analysis.   Sediment toxicity results
      should not the sole parameter used in determining
      sediment quality.  A weight of evidence approach,
      utilizing sediment chemistry, benthic community,
      and any other available information about the site
      is recommended.  The Microtox results should not
      be used for assessments because variable handling
      conditions and extended storage times make these
      data unreliable.  Sediment storage times for the
      amphipod and QwikSed analyses were longer that the
      planned 2 weeks for some samples, which may have
      influenced the results.  The nature of the effect
      of extended storage on the results cannot be
      predicted, however.  Samples for HRGS analysis
      were stored for approximately one year before
      extraction and analysis; this extended storage
      time is not expected to have had a significant
      impact on the HRGS results.  The QwikSed test was
      influenced by elevated ammonia concentrations
      present in some of the elutriate samples.  This
      ammonia was partly the result of sediment storage
      prior to testing.  Consequently, misleading
      conclusions regarding the magnitude of toxicity at
      some stations may arise, unless the inhibitory
      effect of ammonia on luminescence is taken into
      account.  To minimize the effects of ammonia on
      the results, it is recommended that the results of
      the 100% elutriate concentration not be used for
      assessing sediment quality, and that the results
      of the 50% concentration be corrected for the
      influence of ammonia before interpretation.  A
      regression method for correcting the data for
      ammonia interference is provided in the technical
      report accompanying this database.

        VAN VEEN GRABVEEN GRAB  A 0.1 m2 modified Van Veen
        grab will be used to collect sediment samples for
        physical, chemical, and infaunal analysis (Stubbs
        et al. 1987).  This device is manufactured by Kahl
        Scientific Instrument Corporation, 737 West Main
        Street, El Cajon, California 92022 (619/444-2158).
        The grab may be galvanized, stainless steel, or
        Teflon-coated.  All surfaces of the grab must be
        clean and free of rust.  Either single or tandem
        Van Veen grabs are acceptable.  GRAB SAMPLING
        PROCEDURES   Prior to deployment, the grab is
        cocked with the safety key in place.  The grab is
        then hoisted over the side, the safety key is
        removed, the grab is lowered at 2 m/sec until it
        is 5 m above the bottom where it is then lowered
        at 1 m/sec to minimize the effects of bow wave
        disturbance of the surface sediment.  After bottom
        contact has been made (indicated by slack in the
        winch wire), the tension on the wire is slowly
        increased, causing the lever arms to close the
        grab. Once the grab is back on board, the top
        doors are opened for inspection.  The first grab
        collected at a site should be used for the benthic
        infaunal sample.  The chemistry and sediment
        toxicity samples will be collected from subsequent
        grabs.    Different sediment types (e.g. cobble,
        gravel, well sorted sands) and localities (e.g.
        canyons, slopes, rocky areas) may be difficult to
        sample.  Sediments containing rocks create the
        most common problem by preventing complete closure
        of the grab by allowing sediment to wash out
        during retrieval.  Some of the Bight'98 sampling
        sites may occur on these difficult sediment types
        or localities because of the randomized sampling
        design.  Therefore, if after three unsuccessful
        attempts at a site and up to three more
        unsuccessful attempts at each of two other
        locations (within 100 m distance from and ±10% of
        the depth of the nominal site), the station should
        be abandoned.    CRITERIA FOR ACCEPTABLE GRAB
        SAMPLES  Upon retrieval of the grab the
        acceptability of the sample must be determined.
        Acceptability is based upon two characteristics of
        the sample: sample condition, and depth of
        penetration. Sample condition is judged using
        criteria for surface disturbance, leakage,
        canting, and washing.   An acceptable sample
        condition is characterized by an even surface with
        minimal disturbance and little or no leakage of
        the overlying water. Heavily canted samples are
        unacceptable. Samples with a large amount of
        "humping" along the midline of the grab indicating
        washing of the sample during retrieval are also
        unacceptable.  While some humping will be evident
        in samples from firm bottoms where penetration has
        been poor, this is due to the closing action of
        the grab and is not evidence of unacceptable
        washing.  If the sample condition is acceptable,
        the overlying water is drained off and the depth
        of penetration determined by insertion of a
        plastic (rather than metal) ruler vertically along
        the grab midline and measuring to the nearest 0.5
        cm.  Sediment penetration depth must be at least 5
        cm: however, penetration depths of 7-10 cm should
        be obtained in silt (fine sand to clay).   Extra
        caution should be taken to drain the overlying
        water from the grabs for chemistry and toxicity
        samples.  It is recommended that a siphon be
        employed for these grabs to avoid disturbance and
        loss of the surface sediments.  The overlying
        water in grabs intended for infaunal samples may
        be drained by slightly opening the jaws of the
        grab and allowing the water to run off, as long as
        all drained water is captured for screening with
        the sediments (see Sample Processing below).  If
        both sample condition and penetration are
        acceptable, sampling at the station proceeds with
        the collection of chemistry and sediment toxicity
        samples from successive grabs.  It is required
        that all of the grabs taken at a station be of
        similar sediment type and depth penetration.  If
        only one sample of a series of grab attempts is
        usable, the sediment sample should be kept for
        infaunal analysis.  BENTHIC DATA SHEET  The Chief
        Scientist is responsible for the proper completion
        of the Benthic Data Sheet for each station.  The
        information recorded on this sheet includes date,
        time of sampling, weather and sea state,
        navigational position, and other information
        applicable to the sampling site.  For each sample
        collected (i.e. infaunal, chemistry, toxicity),
        sampling failures, grab penetration depth,
        sediment description (type, color, and odor),
        vessel location, and other sample handling
        information are to be recorded.  SEDIMENT
        CHARACTERIZATION  The field description of sediments is
        required following measurement of penetration
        depth.  The sediment should be characterized as
        being coarse sand, fine sand, silt or clay,
        gravel, or of a mixed type.  The presence of
        petroleum tar and shell hash should also be
        recorded.  Obvious odors, such as hydrogen sulfide
        (the odor of rotten eggs), petroleum, other odors,
        or a lack of noticeable odors should be recorded.
        General sediment colors (i.e., black, green,
        brown, red, olive, or gray) should also be
        recorded. Sediment Toxicity Samples  Following the
        collection of sediment chemistry samples, grabs
        will be taken for sediment toxicity analysis.  The
        sediment collected will be used for three
        different types of tests:  amphipod survival,
        Qwiklite luminescence, and sediment water
        interface.  Sediment from all toxicity stations
        will be sampled for the amphipod survival test.
        Additional sediment from a subset of these
        stations (203) will be collected for the Qwiklite
        test.  Samples for sediment water interface tests
        will be collected from 30 stations.  Separate
        sediment samples are required for each of these
        tests.  As with other parts of the program, sample
        containers will be provided by the toxicity
        laboratories performing the required analysis.
        High-density polyethylene (HDPE) containers will
        be used for collection of amphipod and Qwiklite
        sediment samples. Sediment water interface samples
        will be collected in polycarbonate tubes.  All
        sample containers will be provided by the
        analytical laboratory.  Labeling of sample
        containers will be the responsibility of the field
        sampling groups with the following minimum
        information required on each sample label: station
        number, sampling date, parameter, split (if
        required).    Sediment samples for amphipod and
        Qwiklite tests shall be collected from the top 2
        cm by sampling the undisturbed surface material
        with a scoop.  Scoops can be made of plastic
        (e.g., HDPE, Teflon, polycarbonate) or
        Teflon-coated material.  Scoops should be stored
        in plastic bags when not in use.   Contact with
        sediment within 1 cm of the metal sides of the
        grab should be avoided to prevent sample
        contamination.  Sample volume requirements for
        each test are:  Amphipod - 2.25 L (minimum of 1.25
        L), distributed into two 1L containers and a 250
        mL container  Qwiklite   - 125 mL (placed in a 250
        mL container)  When taking sediment toxicity
        samples, the sediment from the grabs should be
        proportionally distributed into each sample
        container.  A 1.5 L minimum will be required for
        sediment toxicity analysis, with at least 60 mL in
        the Qwiklite sample container.  The station will
        be considered completed if 1.5 L of sediment has
        been collected with 5 or more grabs.  If the
        required minimum 1.5 L has been collected with
        fewer than 5 grabs,  then additional grabs will be
        taken until either 2.0 L have been collected, or 5
        total sediment toxicity grabs have been taken.
        Sediments will not be homogenized in the field.
        Each labeled container should then be
        refrigerated, or placed on wet ice.    Samples to
        be analyzed by the Organization conducting the
        collection will be returned to their laboratory by
        the field crew.   Samples to be analyzed by other
        laboratories will be transported to SCCWRP with a
        completed chain of custody sheet.  The samples
        will be stored at SCCWRP for later distribution.
        Additional samples will be collected for sediment
        water interface tests  by personnel from the
        Marine Pollution Studies Laboratory.  A grab will
        be subsampled with a series of small subcores.
        The subcore will be inserted to the sediment to a
        depth of 5 cm and a maximum of six subcores can be
        collected from a grab of sufficient penetration.
        A minimum grab penetration of approximately 10 cm
        will be needed to enable collection of a complete
        set of sample cores.  The bottom of the subcore is
        then closed with a gloved hand for removal, the
        ends are fitted with caps and then wrapped with
        parafilm for a final seal.  The subcores will be
        stored upright in an ice chest and to be later
        hand delivered by MPSL staff to the laboratory.
        Six subcores will be collected from 15 stations
        and 11 subcores collected from an additional 15
        stations.  Any sample collection equipment which
        comes in contact with the sediment should be
        cleaned between stations with the procedures
        described above.  Collection equipment should be
        stored in plastic bags when not in use.
        Alternatively, cleaned "sets" of sample collection
        equipment  may be individually prepared and
        wrapped in plastic per station prior to sampling.
        Samples may be held in the field, or laboratory,
        on wet ice, or in a refrigerator at 4o C, for no
        more than  three days before transport to the
        designated toxicity laboratories.  The
        inter-laboratory transport time will not exceed 24
        hours.   Upon arrival to the analytical
        laboratory, the samples will continue to be stored
        at 4oC.  Testing should begin within two weeks of
        sample collection.  Chain of custody procedures
        should be followed throughout the sampling and
        analysis procedures.

      Methodology_Description:
        Sites were selected using a stratified random
        design.  Five of the strata were located offshore
        (river mouths, large publicly owned treatment
        works [POTW] discharge areas, small POTW discharge
        areas, remaining shallow areas [5-30 m], and
        remaining mid-depth areas [30-120 m]).  Three
        additional strata were located within bays and
        harbors, which included marinas, port/industrial
        areas, and other harbor areas.   Samples were
        collected for four types of toxicity measures: (1)
        amphipod survival, (2) QwikSed, (3) Microtox, and
        (4) P450 Human Reporter Gene System (HRGS).  The
        number of sites sampled within each stratum varied
        among measures because of limitations in
        laboratory capacity and available processing
        effort.  Samples from 241 stations were selected
        for amphipod toxicity measurement, which included
        all bay/harbor stations and a subset of stations
        from the offshore stratum.  Stations sampled for
        the QwikSed and Microtox indicators were a subset
        of those sampled for amphipod toxicity, with the
        primary emphasis on stations within bays and
        harbors.  The largest number of stations was
        selected for the P450 HRGS, which shared the level
        of sampling effort used for sediment chemistry
        measurements.  Sediment samples were collected
        with a 0.1 m2 modified van Veen grab.  A plastic
        (high-density polyethylene [HDPE], polycarbonate,
        or Teflon) scoop was used to collect sediment from
        the top 2 cm of the undisturbed surface material
        in the grab.  Contact with sediment within 1 cm of
        the side of the grab was avoided in order to
        minimize cross-contamination.  Following
        collection, samples were stored on wet ice or
        refrigerated at 4° C.  Organic solvent extracts
        for P450 HRGS analysis were obtained from surface
        sediment samples collected for hydrocarbon
        analysis.  These samples were collected with a
        plastic, stainless steel, or Teflon-coated metal
        scoop, placed in a plastic or glass container with
        a Teflon-lined lid, and then frozen within 24 h of
        collection.  Amphipod Survival Test  Toxicity to
        amphipods was determined using a 10-d survival
        test with Eohaustorius estuarius.  Amphipods and
        negative control sediment were collected from
        Beaver Creek, Oregon, a non-contaminated estuarine
        site, and held in the laboratory at least 4 d, but
        no longer than 14 d, prior to the test.  Testing
        was conducted in 1 L glass test containers.  Tests
        were conducted at 15° C under constant
        illumination.  Test animals were exposed in five
        replicate test chambers for 10 d, with daily
        checks for air and mortality.  Any floating
        animals were submerged by gently pushing them
        beneath the surface with a probe.  At the end of
        the exposure period, the sediment was screened
        through a 0.5 mm screen and the number of
        surviving amphipods was recorded.    A cadmium
        reference toxicity test was conducted concurrently
        with each sediment toxicity test.  The reference
        toxicant test consisted of three replicates of
        five concentrations of dissolved cadmium, plus a
        control.  No sediment was included in the
        reference toxicant tests.  Ten amphipods were
        added to each replicate and exposed to the
        reference toxicant for 4 d and the survival was
        recorded.  Samples of overlying water and
        interstitial water were obtained from the extra
        test container for measurement of initial water
        quality (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen,
        salinity, and total ammonia).  Overlying water
        quality was also measured at the end of the
        exposure period. Water quality measurements made
        for the reference toxicant test were conducted
        using a similar methodology to the sediment phase
        of the test.  QwikSed Elutriate Test  The QwikSed
        elutriate test is a measure of light production
        from the bioluminescent dinoflagellate Gonyaulax
        polyedra following exposure to a sample.  A
        reduction in bioluminescence relative to the
        control reflects an adverse effect of the sample
        on the test organisms.  QwikSed tests were
        conducted on sediment elutriates, which were
        prepared by mixing approximately 75 grams of wet
        sediment with 300 mL of filtered seawater.  The
        mixture was stirred for 30 min and settled for 60
        min; then the supernatant was poured off for use
        in the test.  All elutriates were passed through
        an 8 mm membrane filter prior to mixing for all
        dilutions.  Five elutriate concentrations were
        prepared from the initial sediment-water mixture:
        100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25% .  These dilutions
        were then mixed in 125 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with
        an equivalent volume of dinoflagellate cell stock
        to a final concentration of approximately 200
        cells/mL.  Dinoflagellates were obtained from
        laboratory cultures maintained in a filtered (0.45
        mm) enriched seawater medium (ESM) under 40-watt
        cool-white fluorescent bulbs on a 12:12 h
        (light:dark) cycle at 19° C.  A control sample
        (ESM only) was included with each elutriate sample
        tested.  Three mL from each of the elutriate
        dilution flasks were pipetted into each of five
        disposable spectrophotometer cuvettes (five
        replicates per concentration).  The cells were
        then incubated for 24 h at 19° C at a light
        intensity of 4,000 lux on a 12D:12L h photoperiod.
        Total mechanical stimulable light (TMSL) was
        measured from each of the cuvettes after 24 h,
        using the QwikSed photometer system.  The contents
        of the cuvette were stirred while in the
        photometer, stimulating the dinoflagellates to
        emit light that was detected by a photomultiplier
        tube (PMT).  The PMT counts were accumulated
        during stirring and compared to the control
        response.    The salinity of the prepared
        elutriates was checked with a refractometer and
        maintained at ~33 g/kg.  Total ammonia was
        measured with an Orion ammonia electrode; the
        temperature and pH of the elutriate were measured
        concurrently.  Total ammonia was measured in all
        100% elutriates and then converted to unionized
        ammonia.  Unionized ammonia concentrations were
        then back-calculated for all dilutions in each
        sample.  Four reference toxicity tests with copper
        sulfate were conducted during the testing period.
        Two tests were conducted on August 25, 1998, a
        third test was conducted on September 16, 1998,
        and a fourth test was conducted on January 8,
        1999.    Microtox Interstitial Water Test
        Sediment interstitial (pore) water was assessed
        using the MicrotoxTM Rapid Toxicity Testing
        System, in which a change in light production from
        a luminescent bacterium relative to a control
        sample is used to measure toxicity.  Interstitial
        water was obtained by centrifuging the sediment at
        3,000 g for 20 min.  The resulting interstitial
        water samples were stored either under
        refrigeration or frozen in borosilicate glass
        vials with Teflon-lined lids.  The samples were
        analyzed using a Microtox M500 analyzer following
        the Microtox Comparison Test Method (Microbics
        Corp. 1995).  Bacteria (Vibrio fischeri strain
        NRRL B-11177) were added to triplicate cuvettes
        containing 1.5 mL of 100% interstitial water and
        incubated at 15° C for 15 min.  The luminescence
        of each replicate was measured and compared to a
        matching control (seawater) sample. The percent of
        difference in mean light production in the samples
        relative to the control sample was then
        calculated. Reproducibility of the test organism
        response was determined by testing a phenol
        reference toxicant solution at a single
        concentration.   P450 HRGS Solvent Extract Test
        The P450 human reporter gene system (HRGS) test
        measures changes in luminescence of human hepatoma
        cells transfected with a luciferase reporter gene
        following exposure to solvent extracts of
        sediment.  An increase in luminescence indicates
        that the sample contains organic compounds that
        induce the production of cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1),
        such as PAHs, dioxins, furans, and coplanar PCBs.
        Hexane extracts of sediments were prepared and
        then exchanged into dichloromethane (DCM) before
        testing.  Extracts were applied at a volume of 2
        mL to single or duplicate wells in six-well plates
        containing 2 mL of culture media.  After 16 h
        incubation, the cells were washed with Hank's
        Balanced Salt Solution (Mediatech, Herndon, VA)
        and lysed with 200 mL of a solution containing 1%
        Triton, 25 mM Tricine, pH 7.8, 15 mM MgSO4, 4 mM
        EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT).  Cell lysates
        were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 10 s, and 50 mL
        of the supernatant was applied to a 96-well plate,
        followed by addition of luciferase assay reagents.
        Luminescence in relative light units (RLUs) was
        measured using a ML2250 Luminometer (Dynatech
        Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) and divided by the
        RLUs measured for a solvent blank sample to
        determine the fold induction of the sample.  The
        analyses also included a method blank for each
        extraction batch, as well as extracts of the Santa
        Monica Bay (SMB) reference sediment used for
        interlaboratory calibration studies by the
        Bight'98 analytical chemistry laboratories.  These
        samples were tested by HRGS concurrently with the
        sediment samples.  A reference toxicant, 1 ng/mL
        Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), was included
        with each test batch.  The HRGS results were
        reported in terms of benzo[a]pyrene equivalents on
        a dry weight basis (mg/g B[a]PEq).  These values
        were calculated from the mean fold induction
        responses, based upon the HRGS
        concentration-response curve for benzo[a]pyrene,
        the amount of extract applied, the volume of the
        extract, and the sample dry weight.

      Methodology_Description:
        The results of each toxicity test should be
        summarized by reporting the mean, standard
        deviation, and number of replicates for each
        station.  Reporting of significant toxic effects
        at any station should be based on a statistical
        test, such as an unequal variance t-test, where
        the sample is compared to the control.
        Application of a minimum significant difference
        threshold in classifying as toxic is recommended
        as an aid to minimizing the occurrence of
        nonreproducible statistically significant
        differences which are due to atypically low
        variance among replicates.  The minimum
        significant difference thresholds used for this
        study were: 20% (amphipod survival) and 14%
        (QwikSed luminescence).
