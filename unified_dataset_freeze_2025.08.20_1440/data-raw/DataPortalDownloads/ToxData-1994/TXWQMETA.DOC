Number of Stations Sampled:  72

Sampling Period:  13 July 1994 -- 22 August 1994

Number Of Variables Measured:  7:  Data for pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature, total sulfides, 
total ammonia and un-ionized ammonia in interstitial water samples from toxicity testing and overlying 
water from whole sediment toxicity tests.  Bioassay data appears in the file TOX_DATA.TXT.

Sampling Equipment Used:  Sediment for toxicity sampling was collected with a modified, chain-rigged 
0.1m2 Van Veen grab.

Analytical Techniques:  Interstitial water toxicity testing was performed at SCCWRP using embryos of the 
purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, following methods of the EPA’s West Coast Manual.  
Whole sediment testing was performed at SCCWRP and SAIC in Rhode Island.  Whole sediment tests used 
the amphipod, Ampelisca abdita, by the methods in ASTM.

Data Set Verification:  Data set verified by toxicologists from SCCWRP.

General Comments:
               This data set includes minimum and maximum values for water quality parameters measured 
during the performance of toxicity tests for the SCBPP.  Each record has the following fields (variables):  
Log Number, QA Batch, Lab Code, Parameter, Dilution, Minimum and Maximum.  The log number is a 10 
digit code in the following form:
                                            Digit
                                                1                   -                           P for Pilot Project
                                             2 & 3               -                           Agency collecting the sediment
                                             4 & 5               -                           Type of data (ST = Sediment toxicity)
                                             6 to 9               -                           Station number
                                                10                 -                            Replicate number.

For agency collecting sediment, EC = Control sediment collected by SCCWRP’s amphipod supplier; SA = 
Control sediment collected by SAIC in Rhode Island;  SC= Centrifugation blank created in the SCCWRP 
laboratory;  HY= Hyperion Treatment Plant;  LA= County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County;  
ME= MEC Analytical Systems, Inc. and SD= City of San Diego.  The replicate digit will be 0 in all cases 
except when a sample has been split between SCCWRP and SAIC for toxicity testing.  In those cases, the 
replicate value is 0 for the sample tested by SCCWRP and 1 for the sample tested by SAIC.


QA Batch is the internal experiment designation by either SCCWRP or SAIC.

Lab Code is the two letter code for the laboratory that performed the bioassay.  Either SC for SCCWRP or 
NG for SAIC in Rhode Island.

Parameter is the water quality parameter measured.  PH = pH; DO = dissolved oxygen in milligrams/liter; 
SAL = Salinity in grams/kilogram; TEMP = temperature in degrees centrigrade;  NH3T = total ammonia in 
milligrams/liter;  STP = total sulfides in milligrams/liter;  NH3U= un-ionized ammonia in milligrams/liter.

Dilution is percentage of sample that was interstitial water.  Null indicates 100% sample.

Station locations can be found in the Benthic Master Sample File, except for the following three control 
sites.  All log numbers having the EC agency code, except station 3002, were a negative control station 
where the amphipods were collected in Rhode Island (lat:41.443889, long:71.456944).  Station 3002 was a 
positive control site for the amphipod test.  This station was located in Wickford Harbor, Rhode Island 
(lat:41.582222,long:71.425).  All stations with the SA agency code were for the negative control station 
used by SAIC for there amphipod tests.  This station is located in Long Island Sound (lat:41.1325, 
long:72.87833).  Descriptive data on sediment color and texture and depth of penetration of the grab for 
SCBPP stations are available from SCCWRP on request.

Field and Laboratory Techniques:  Measurements of pH were made using an Orion model 91-157 pH 
Triode electrode attached to a Orion Model 290A portable meter.  Dissolved oxygen was measured with an 
Orion Model 810 portable meter/electrode.  Conductivity was measured with an Orion model 124 
meter/probe.  The conductivity measurements were converted to salinity mathematically.  Temperature was 
continuously monitored during the experiments using electronic thermometers.  Total sulfides were 
measured through a calorimetric method.  Total ammonia was measured using an Orion model 95-12 
specific ion electrode attached to a Corning model 150 benchtop meter.  Un-ionized ammonia was 
calculated by the methods of Hampson (1977).

Quality Assurance And Quality Control Evaluation:  Calibrations were performed on all water quality 
measurement apparatus on the days they were used.  Duplicate measurements were made on a subset of 
samples to verify instrument reproducibility and stability.

Data Use and Comparability:  The data are appropriate for determining water quality conditions during the 
toxicity tests.  The data are appropriate for comparing conditions between exposures and between the 
laboratories that conducted the bioassays.  Since the data were not collected in the field, they should not be 
used for determining water quality conditions in the field.
	For the interstitial water data, there was an interference in toxicity data caused by ammonia.  
Ammonia levels were found to have increased greatly during storage of the sediments and led to many 
samples appearing to be more toxic than would have been expected if no ammonia was present.  The 
toxicity data must therefore be viewed in light of the water quality data.
