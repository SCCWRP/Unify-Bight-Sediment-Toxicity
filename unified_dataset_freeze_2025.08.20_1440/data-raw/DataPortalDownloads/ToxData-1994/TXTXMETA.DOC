Number of Stations Sampled:  72

Sampling Period:  13 July 1994 -- 22 August 1994

Number Of Variables Measured:  2:  Interstitial water toxicity measured as number of normal embryos and 
un-ionized ammonia concentrations from those samples.  Measurements are expressed as averages for the 
station.  Note that all data in this file are for the 25% interstitial water concentration.  Water quality data 
from the exposures appears in the file TOX_WQ.TXT.  Since the interstitial water tests were affected by 
interference from ammonia, data from interstitial water tests should not be used without consideration of 
this factor.  Data presented in this file are the results of a method for factoring out the effect of ammonia 
toxicity.

Sampling Equipment Used:  Sediment for toxicity sampling was collected with a modified, chain-rigged 
0.1m2 Van Veen grab.

Analytical Techniques:  Interstitial water toxicity testing was performed at SCCWRP using embryos of the 
purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, following methods of the EPA’s West Coast Manual.  
Total ammonia measurements were performed using an Orion 95-12 selective ion probe.  Un-ionized 
ammonia was calculated using the methods of Hampson (1977).

Data Set Verification:  Data set verified by toxicologists from SCCWRP.

General Comments:
               This data set includes mean percent normal development of embryos, mean concentration of un-
ionized ammonia, and predicted mean percent normal development and the degree of toxicity for the 
station after the effect of ammonia is factored out.  All data is for the 25% interstitial water concentration.  
Each record has the following fields (variables):  Log Number, MeanNH3, ID, MEANNORM and 1%CI.  
The log number is a 10 digit code in the following form:
                                            Digit
                                              1                   -                           P for Pilot Project
                                             2 & 3                -                           Agency collecting the sediment
                                             4 & 5                -                           Type of data (ST = Sediment toxicity)
                                             6 to 9               -                           Station number
                                               10                 -                           Replicate number.

For agency collecting sediment, EC = Control sediment collected by SCCWRP’s amphipod supplier; SA = 
Control sediment collected by SAIC in Rhode Island;  SC= Centrifugation blank created in the SCCWRP 
laboratory;  HY= Hyperion Treatment Plant;  LA= County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County;  
ME= MEC Analytical Systems, Inc. and SD= City of San Diego.  The replicate digit will be 0 in all cases 
except when a sample has been split between SCCWRP and SAIC for toxicity testing.  In those cases, the 
replicate value is 0 for the sample tested by SCCWRP and 1 for the sample tested by SAIC.

MeanNH3 is the mean un-ionized ammonia concentration during the interstitial water bioassay.

ID is the designation of the station as indeterminate, toxic or non-toxic (see further explanation in the 
“Field and Laboratory Techniques” section below .

MEANNORM is the mean percent normal development of embryos for the 25% concentration of 
interstitial water (see further explanation in the “Field and Laboratory Techniques” section below).

1%CI is the predicted mean percent normal development based on the logistic equation of un-ionized 
ammonia with percent normal development (see further explanation in the “Field and Laboratory 
Techniques” section below).

Station locations can be found in the Benthic Master Sample File, except for the following three control 
sites.  All log numbers having the EC agency code, except station 3002, were a negative control station 
where the amphipods were collected in Rhode Island (lat:41.443889, long:71.456944).  Station 3002 was a 
postitive control site for the amphipod test.  This station was located in Wickford Harbor, Rhode Island 
(lat:41.582222,long:71.425).  All stations with the SA agency code were for the negative control station 
used by SAIC for there amphipod tests.  This station is located in Long Island Sound (lat:41.1325, 
long:72.87833).  Descriptive data on sediment color and texture and depth of penetration of the grab for 
SCBPP stations are available from SCCWRP on request.

Field and Laboratory Techniques:  Sediment for toxicity analysis was collected with a modified 0.1m2 Van 
Veen grab.  A minimum of three liters of surface (top 2 cm) sediment was collected from each station.  
Sediment was stored in one liter polyethylene jars at 3-5  C for up to four weeks..  Interstitial water was 
obtained by centrifuging approximately 400 ml of homogenized, unscreened sediment at 3,000 x g for 30 
min.  Samples with pH less than 7.5 were adjusted to 7.6-8.0.  Three concentrations of interstitial water 
(100, 50 and 25%) were prepared if sufficient sample volume was available.  Three replicates of each 
concentration were tested.  Purple sea urchin embryos were added to the interstitial water and allowed to 
develop for 72 h at 15  C.  Embryo samples were then preserved and examined microscopically for normal 
development.

Quality Assurance And Quality Control Evaluation:  Most of the tests met the QA criteria set forth in the 
SCBPP Quality Assurance Plan.  Some concentrations of interstitial water were not done because of 
insufficient sample volume.  Many of the interstitial water samples have reduced numbers of replicates.  
Reduced replication resulted when the lower concentrations exhibited complete toxicity (0% normal).  
When lower concentrations exhibited complete toxicity, only one replicate of the higher concentration was 
examined microscopically to confirm toxicity.
	Reference toxicant tests indicated that the animals were within expected sensitivity ranges for all 
experiments.

Data Use and Comparability:  The data are appropriate for the comparison between stations at the time of 
sampling.  The data are appropriate for the use with other data collected during the SCBPP.
