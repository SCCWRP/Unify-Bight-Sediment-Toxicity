  Description:
    Abstract:
      Two hundred and twenty-eight sites between Point
      Conception, California, and the United
      States-Mexico international border were sampled
      between July 1 and September 30, 2003.  Two
      hundred and eight sites were selected using a
      stratified random design to ensure
      representativeness and minimize bias.  A total of
      six strata were sampled.  Three strata were
      located offshore and included the continental
      shelf (5-200 m depth), the continental slope
      (200-500 m depth), and the Channel Islands
      (30-120m depth).  Three strata were located
      inshore and included estuaries, marinas, and
      ports/bays/harbors areas.  The remaining 20 sites
      were not randomly chosen, but were selected from
      within the inshore strata based on their proximity
      to anthropogenic inputs and potential for sediment
      toxicity.    Ten-day solid phase sediment toxicity
      tests were conducted using the amphipod
      Eohaustorius estuarius on all samples.  This
      standardized test has been used by EPA, NOAA, and
      was used in the previous SCB regional survey
      (Bight'98).    Of the 208 randomly selected
      stations collected, 191 (92%) were successfully
      tested which exceeded our data quality objectives
      of 90% success.  Control survival, holding times,
      and reference toxicants were all acceptable for
      these samples.  The remaining 17 samples were
      discarded because control survival (76%) did not
      meet quality control criteria (90%).  A pre-survey
      intercalibration study using marine sediments
      split among participating laboratories
      demonstrated comparability between testing
      facilities.  The intercalibration was repeated
      during the survey with similar results.  Three
      levels were delineated for assessing sediment
      toxicity in this study.  The first level was
      "nontoxic" where amphipod survival was >83%
      relative to controls.  The 83% level was based
      upon the minimum significant difference approach
      whereby amphipod survival <83% would be considered
      significant in at least 90% of the samples based
      on replicate variability.  The second level was
      "moderately toxic" where amphipod survival was
      >50% and < 83% relative to control survival and
      was significantly different from controls using
      standardized t-tests.  The third level was "highly
      toxic" where amphipod survival was <50% relative
      to control survival.  The 50% level corresponds to
      a high probability of degraded benthos based on
      previous regional monitoring results from
      Bight'98.  Sediment toxicity was not widespread in
      the SCB.  No sediment toxicity was observed in an
      estimated 7,807 km2 (83%) of the SCB.  Stations
      located near the Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary
      were found to have the lowest incidence of
      toxicity (4%).  Marinas and estuaries contained
      the greatest incidence of observed sediment
      toxicity.  Toxicity was present in marinas and
      estuaries at 50% and 41% of the area,
      respectively.  In addition, marina and estuary
      strata had the greatest relative contribution of
      highly toxic sediments (16% and 14%,
      respectively).    The extent of sediment toxicity
      in the SCB has changed little over the past five
      years.  Comparisons to Bight'98 indicate a similar
      level (19%) of overall observed sediment toxicity
      throughout the SCB.  Also similar to Bight'98, the
      relative distribution of sediment toxicity was
      greatest in marinas.  The confidence in temporal
      comparisons will improve as additional surveys are
      conducted.
    Purpose:
      The goal of this study was to answer two
      questions: 1) What percent of area in the SCB
      contains sediments toxic to marine organisms?; and
      2) How does sediment toxicity compare among
      specific areas of interest?  The batch information
      file provides data on the conduct of individual
      test batches, such as laboratory, date and quality
      assurance information.

      Sediment toxicity:  Toxicity tests provide a
      direct measure of the effect of contamination on
      benthic organisms.  These tests complement
      sediment chemistry measurements by providing a
      measure of the combined toxic effect of the
      complex mixture of contaminants present in
      sediment or in the water in the pores between
      sediment grains (interstitial water).  Sediment
      samples will be collected from the top 2 cm of a
      Van Veen grab sample.  The toxicity of bulk
      sediments will be assessed using an amphipod
      survival test conducted according to USEPA
      methods.  Amphipods will be exposed to a 2 cm
      layer of test sediment for 10 days and then
      examined to determine the percent survival.  The
      amphipod Eohaustorius estuarius was selected for
      this study because of its wide tolerance to
      variations in habitat characteristics and to
      provide comparability with recent toxicity
      information from other monitoring programs in
      California.

  Use_Constraints:
    This database contains information for quality
    assurance samples (e.g. split samples and
    reference toxicants) as well as sediment samples.
    Caution should be exercised in using the toxicity
    results reported here as the sole basis for
    describing sediment quality in the SCB.  Toxicity
    tests, like other indicators of sediment quality
    such as chemistry and benthic community
    assessment, have limitations that result in a
    likelihood that some errors in classification will
    occur.  Each of the stations tested for sediment
    toxicity was also analyzed for sediment chemistry
    and benthic macrofauna community composition, and
    the results for these parameters will be reported
    in future Bight'03 documents.  The results from
    all of these lines of evidence should be used to
    make an assessment of sediment quality for the
    SCB.  Data from one QA Batch of samples was
    removed from the database because the controls did
    not meet acceptability criteria and could not be
    retested within the designated 28 day holding
    time.  Three test batches met the acceptability
    criteria of having a mean control survival of 90%
    or greater, but did not achieve the single
    replicate control survival criteria of 80%..  This
    deviation occurred in control replicate 5 of Batch
    3 (65% survival), control replicate 5 of Batch 10
    (70% survival), and control replicate 4 of Batch
    11 (75% survival).  An investigation was performed
    on these batches to determine if the variability
    within the control survival data impacted the
    ability of these tests to determine significant
    differences between the control and each of the
    samples.  In order to assess potential bias, a
    conceptual model was developed that included
    comparing the batch sample results to a mock
    control data set, which had the highest achievable
    coefficient of variation (CV) while still meeting
    acceptability criteria.  All possible combinations
    of five-replicate data sets were generated and the
    CV was calculated for each.  The greatest CV
    calculated from these data sets was 11.91
    (designated CVmax).  Batch 3 and Batch 11 had CV
    values less than the CVmax (11.5 and 8,
    respectively).  This indicates that the ability to
    determine significant differences between the
    controls and the sample treatments of the
    respective batches was not less than the
    worst-case scenario CVmax.  The data from these
    two batches were accepted into the database, but
    were flagged as not meeting control acceptability
    criteria.  Batch 10, however, had a CV of 13.1,
    exceeding the CVmax of 11.91.  In this case, the
    survival from each station was analyzed for a
    statistical difference to the survival of the mock
    control data set that generated the CVmax.  This
    information was compared to the data generated
    with the original test batch control.  The results
    of the statistical testing using the batch control
    and the CVmax mock control were found to be
    identical.  Batch 10 was accepted into the
    database, but flagged as not meeting control
    acceptability criteria.   There were three
    stations that were inadvertently sampled on two
    separate occasions and toxicity testing was
    completed on both samples.  Chemistry values are
    only available for one of the sampling times at
    each station.  Since the toxicity data represent
    the only repeated sampling at a station, the data
    for both sample periods is in the database.  The
    samples for which no matching chemistry is
    available were flagged as QA samples.

    Methodology:
      Methodology_Type: Analysis
      Methodology_Description:
        Data were analyzed using two methods: (1)
        calculation of the mean response relative to the
        control for each batch and (2) assessment of the
        percent area within each stratum that was
        classified as nontoxic, moderately toxic or highly
        toxic on the basis of survival thresholds.
        Calculation of the response relative to the
        control is simply the amphipod survival at a given
        station divided by the mean percent survival of
        the associated control for that batch multiplied
        by 100.  This adjustment is sometimes referred to
        as Abbott's correction.  For the amphipod test,
        two criteria had to be met before a sample could
        be classified as toxic: (1) a statistically
        significant reduction in survival compared to the
        control; and (2) a minimum percent reduction in
        survival between the sample and control.
        Statistical significance was determined by
        performing a t-test between the sample and control
        with a 0.05 level of significance.  A reduction in
        mean survival of greater than 17% relative to the
        control (i.e., a control normalized survival of
        less than 83%) was classified as toxic.  This
        threshold was calculated using the minimum
        significant difference (MSD) approach following
        Phillips et al. (2001).  The 17% toxicity
        threshold was established by first calculating MSD
        relative to the control for every t-test in the
        Bight'03 dataset.  The MSD values were then ranked
        and the 90th percentile value was selected
        (Phillips et al. 2001).  Based on this MSD
        calculation, samples having a survival less than
        83% of the control would be expected to be
        significantly different from the control 90% of
        the time.    Samples that were identified as toxic
        were further separated into two categories.  A
        sample with a survival that was less than 50% of
        the control was classified as "highly toxic".  The
        threshold for high toxicity was chosen to
        correspond to a high probability of occurrence of
        a degraded benthos, based on the results of the
        Bight'98 study (Ranasinghe et al. 2003).  The 50%
        survival threshold also represented a response
        that was certain to be significantly different
        from the control; there was less than a 0.001%
        chance of obtaining <50% survival for a sample by
        chance.  Samples that were significantly different
        from the control and with survival between 50 and
        83% of the control were classified as "moderately
        toxic".  Area weights were calculated by taking
        the total area (km2) of a given strata and
        dividing by the number of samples in that strata.
        The total area determined to be nontoxic,
        moderately toxic and highly toxic for a given
        strata were calculated by summing the area weights
        for each station that fell into a given category
        of toxicity. Percent area was calculated by taking
        the total area for a given strata and toxicity
        level and dividing by the total area for the given
        strata.  A Harvitz-Thompson ratio estimator was
        used to calculate the confidence intervals.
        Variance estimates for the proportion estimates
        were calculated using the simple random sampling
        (SRS) variance estimator.  Confidence bounds were
        calculated using a Normal distribution multiplier
        (Diaz-Ramos et al. 1996).

      Methodology_Description:
        Two hundred and eight sites on the continental
        shelf between Point Conception, California, and
        the United States-Mexico international border were
        sampled between July 1 and September 30, 2003.
        Sites were selected using a stratified random
        design (Stevens 1997).  A total of six strata were
        sampled.  Three offshore strata included the
        Channel Islands and two strata that were
        characterized by depth; Shelf (5-200 m) and Slope
        (mainland slope at depths of 200-500 m).  Three
        strata were located inshore within embayments;
        Estuaries, Ports/Bays/Harbors, and Marinas.  In
        addition to the stratified random sites, 20
        non-random sites were located in areas expected to
        have benthic community impacts, in order to refine
        the Benthic Response Index (BRI) (Smith et al.
        2001).  Methods for the selection of the BRI
        stations are presented in Appendix C of the
        report.  	Sites were selected randomly within each
        stratum, rather than by investigator
        pre-selection, to ensure that they were
        representative and could be extrapolated to the
        response of the entire stratum.  For all strata, a
        systematic component was added to the selection
        process to minimize clustering of sample sites.
        The systematic element was accomplished by using
        an extension of the sampling design used in the
        Bight'98 regional survey and in the Environmental
        Protection Agency's (EPA's) Environmental
        Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) (Stevens
        1997).  A hexagonal grid was placed over a map of
        the sampling area, a random subsample of hexagon
        cells was chosen from this population, and one
        sample was obtained at a randomly selected site
        within each grid cell.  The hexagonal grid
        structure ensures systematic separation of the
        sampling effort, while the random selection of
        sites within grid cells ensures an unbiased
        estimate of ecological condition.  Additional
        details of this site selection process are
        provided in the Coastal Ecology Work Plan (Bight
        '03 Steering Committee 2003).  Sediment samples
        were collected with a 0.1 m2 modified Van Veen
        grab.  Up to 2.5 L of sediment were collected for
        measurement of sediment toxicity using the
        amphipod survival test.  A plastic (high-density
        polyethylene [HDPE], polycarbonate, or Teflon)
        scoop was used to collect sediment from the top 2
        cm of the undisturbed surface material in the
        grab.  Contact with sediment within 1 cm of the
        side of the grab was avoided in order to minimize
        cross-contamination.  The sediment was placed in
        clean HDPE containers and distributed to the
        testing laboratories.  Following collection,
        samples were stored on wet ice or refrigerated in
        the dark at 4  C for no longer than four weeks
        prior to testing.

      Methodology_Description:
        Sediment Toxicity Samples  Following the
        collection of sediment chemistry samples, grabs
        will be taken for sediment toxicity analysis.
        More than one grab may be necessary to meet the
        sample volume requirements of this sample type.
        If a second grab is necessary, the sediment from
        each grab will be distributed evenly among the
        individual sample containers. Sediments will not
        be homogenized in the field.   Sediment samples
        will be collected by randomly sub-sampling the top
        2 cm of the undisturbed surface material with a
        plastic scoop.  At the very minimum, the scoop
        will be washed with soap and water and rinsed with
        de-ionized (DI) water between stations. Use of a
        new scoop with each sample is also acceptable.
        Sediment within 1 cm of the metal sides of the
        grab will be avoided to prevent sample
        contamination.  High-density polyethylene (HDPE)
        containers will be used for collection of sediment
        toxicity samples. The toxicity laboratories
        performing the required analysis will provide
        sample containers.   Sample volume requirements
        for sediment toxicity samples are:  •	2.5 liters
        of sediment is the target volume at stations where
        sediment collection is not problematic. However,
        if after nine grab attempts at a site yielding
        intermittent success insufficient sample volume is
        available, 1.0 liter of sediment will satisfy the
        minimum sampling requirement.  Sample volumes less
        than 1.0 L will be considered unacceptable, the
        sample will be discarded and the reason for
        incomplete sampling at the site will be recorded.
        The 2.5 L of sediment will be distributed among
        three high-density polyethylene (HDPE) containers
        with Teflon-lined lids.  Each labeled container
        should then be refrigerated, or placed on wet ice.
        Do not freeze these samples.  Samples may be held
        in the field, or laboratory, on wet ice, or in a
        refrigerator at 4o C, for no more than three days
        before transport to the laboratory or SCCWRP.  The
        transport time  will not exceed 24 hours and
        storage temperature will not exceed 4o C.
        Labeling of sample containers will be the
        responsibility of the field sampling crews with
        the following minimum information required on each
        sample label: 1) station number; 2) sampling date;
        3) parameter; and 4) split (if required).   If the
        samples will be analyzed by other laboratories,
        they will be transported to SCCWRP for later
        distribution.  It is recommended that SCCWRP
        (Darrin Greenstein, 714/372-9224) be contacted
        prior to delivery of samples so that arrangements
        can be made to transfer custody.  A completed
        chain of custody form must accompany all shipments
        of samples (Appendix 6).  Allow time for
        verification of the chain of custody.

        VII.   SEDIMENT TOXICITY TESTING   A.   Overview
        This section describes QA/QC procedures that will
        be used for the assessment of sediment toxicity
        during the Bight’03 Survey.  Only one toxicity
        test will be used for assessment of the sediment.
        The toxicity of whole sediment will be measured
        using an amphipod (Eohaustorius estuarius)
        survival test.   B.   Laboratory Capability
        Prior to participating in the Bight 03 survey,
        the test laboratory must document their ability to
        conduct the tests with the selected test species.
        This should consist of a record of at least three
        prior tests in which test acceptability was
        attained.  In addition, the laboratory should have
        conducted at least three prior reference toxicant
        tests so that a control chart can be constructed.
        A written description of the test method used must
        also be provided to the Steering Committee prior
        to the analysis of samples.   C.   Interlaboratory
        Comparability  	All laboratories conducting the
        amphipod survival tests must participate in an
        interlaboratory comparison exercise prior to
        sample testing.  This exercise will include the
        analysis of field collected sediments and a
        reference toxicant test.  Successful completion of
        this exercise by a laboratory will be evaluated
        using two criteria: 1) attainment of test
        acceptability criteria, and 2) agreement of
        results between laboratories.  The criteria for
        establishing agreement of results will be
        determined by the Toxicology Committee.
        Laboratories unable to successfully complete the
        interlaboratory comparison exercise will be asked
        to examine their test procedures, make suggested
        changes, and retest the comparison samples.
        Failure to meet the interlaboratory comparison
        criteria will result in the addition of a
        cautionary data qualifier flag to that
        laboratory’s data.  	In additon to the
        intercalibration before sample testing, additonal
        split samples will be tested by the laboratories
        during the project.  These samples will be used to
        verify that the results remain comparable during
        the course of testing.  The results of these
        additional samples will be for informational
        purposes only.  D.   Sample Collection  	Methods
        for collection of sediment are described in the
        Field Operations Manual.  Surface sediment (top 2
        cm) will be collected from Van Veen grabs and
        stored in precleaned polyethylene jars.  Samples
        may be stored in the dark at 4 ?C  for up to two
        weeks before testing.  Sediment samples should be
        press sieved through a 2 mm screen and homogenized
        in the laboratory before testing.  	All samples
        shall be accompanied by chain of custody and
        sample tracking forms.  These forms should include
        dates of receipt, homogenization, and testing of
        each sample, as well as storage conditions.  E.
        Amphipod Survival Test  	An amphipod survival test
        will be conducted according to (EPA 1994)
        guidelines.  This test consists of a 10-day
        exposure of Eohaustorius estuarius to sediment
        under static conditions.  Amphipods are placed in
        glass chambers containing seawater and a 2 cm
        layer of test sediment.  The number of surviving
        amphipods is measured at the end of the test and
        used to calculate the percentage survival.
        Quality of test organisms  	All test organisms
        will be obtained from a common source during the
        survey.  Species identification should be verified
        through consultation with a taxonomist, if
        necessary.  Individuals selected for testing
        should be visually inspected to confirm that they
        are the proper size and in good condition (i.e.,
        no external damage).  Holding time prior to
        testing should be 10 days or less.  Accuracy and
        precision  	The accuracy of sediment toxicity
        tests of field samples cannot be determined since
        a reference material of known toxicity is not
        available.  A reference toxicant test will be run
        with every batch of test samples in order to
        document amphipod relative sensitivity and test
        precision. This test will consist of a 96-hour
        exposure to five different concentrations of
        cadmium dissolved in seawater.  Cadmium
        concentrations will be selected to provide an
        estimate of the LC50 and will be verified by
        chemical analysis of one of the exposure
        treatments (e.g., the median test concentration).
        Reference toxicant test results that fall outside
        of control chart limits (2 sd of mean) will
        trigger a review of test procedures and a possible
        retest of the corresponding sediment samples.
        Test conditions  	Water quality of the overlying
        water and pore water will be measured for each
        sample type at the beginning and end of the
        exposure.  Temperature will be measured
        continuously in the exposure room.  Instruments
        will be calibrated daily.  Deviations in water
        quality will be noted on the data files.
        Interference by ammonia  	The presence of high
        concentrations of ammonia in pore water may be a
        confounding factor for sediment toxicity tests
        with Eohaustorius.  Laboratories will be required
        to measure the concentration of un-ionized ammonia
        in the pore water from each station, prior to the
        start of toxicity testing.  If the pore water
        concentration exceeds the limit of 0.8 mg/L
        un-ionized ammonia for any station within a batch,
        the laboratory will be required to perform a
        similtaneous ammonia reference toxicant test along
        with that batch.  The results of the ammonia
        reference toxicant testing will be compared to the
        concentrations of ammonia in the test samples to
        determine if the levels are high enough to account
        for any observed toxicity in the sediment samples.
        Test acceptability 	 	This toxicity test
        procedure is considered unacceptable if amphipod
        survival in "home sediment" is less than 90%, or
        if survival in any control replicate is less than
        80%.  Reference toxicant results must also be
        within two standard deviations of the mean
        response specific to the laboratory.  Water
        quality parameters (salinity, temperature, pH, and
        ammonia) should also be within the tolerance range
        of the test organism, as specified in EPA (1994)
        guidance.    	A sediment holding time of no more
        than two weeks has been established in order to
        minimize the potential alteration of the  sediment
        toxicity due to storage; this time period is not a
        criterion for judging test acceptability.  Tests
        on samples that are stored from greater than two
        weeks up to four weeks will also be considered
        valid, but a data qualifier will be attached to
        the record to indicate that the desired storage
        time was been exceeded.   Samples stored for more
        than four weeks before the start of toxicity
        testing will be considered unacceptable for
        testing and the data will not be included in the
        project database.

      Methodology_Description:
        Two hundred and eight sites on the continental
        shelf between Point Conception, California, and
        the United States-Mexico international border were
        sampled between July 1 and September 30, 2003.
        Sites were selected using a stratified random
        design (Stevens 1997).  A total of six strata were
        sampled.  Three offshore strata included the
        Channel Islands and two strata that were
        characterized by depth; Shelf (5-200 m) and Slope
        (mainland slope at depths of 200-500 m).  Three
        strata were located inshore within embayments;
        Estuaries, Ports/Bays/Harbors, and Marinas.  In
        addition to the stratified random sites, 20
        non-random sites were located in areas expected to
        have benthic community impacts, in order to refine
        the Benthic Response Index (BRI) (Smith et al.
        2001).  Methods for the selection of the BRI
        stations are presented in Appendix C of the
        report.  	Sites were selected randomly within each
        stratum, rather than by investigator
        pre-selection, to ensure that they were
        representative and could be extrapolated to the
        response of the entire stratum.  For all strata, a
        systematic component was added to the selection
        process to minimize clustering of sample sites.
        The systematic element was accomplished by using
        an extension of the sampling design used in the
        Bight'98 regional survey and in the Environmental
        Protection Agency's (EPA's) Environmental
        Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) (Stevens
        1997).  A hexagonal grid was placed over a map of
        the sampling area, a random subsample of hexagon
        cells was chosen from this population, and one
        sample was obtained at a randomly selected site
        within each grid cell.  The hexagonal grid
        structure ensures systematic separation of the
        sampling effort, while the random selection of
        sites within grid cells ensures an unbiased
        estimate of ecological condition.  Additional
        details of this site selection process are
        provided in the Coastal Ecology Work Plan (Bight
        '03 Steering Committee 2003).  Sediment samples
        were collected with a 0.1 m2 modified Van Veen
        grab.  Up to 2.5 L of sediment were collected for
        measurement of sediment toxicity using the
        amphipod survival test.  A plastic (high-density
        polyethylene [HDPE], polycarbonate, or Teflon)
        scoop was used to collect sediment from the top 2
        cm of the undisturbed surface material in the
        grab.  Contact with sediment within 1 cm of the
        side of the grab was avoided in order to minimize
        cross-contamination.  The sediment was placed in
        clean HDPE containers and distributed to the
        testing laboratories.  Following collection,
        samples were stored on wet ice or refrigerated in
        the dark at 4  C for no longer than four weeks
        prior to testing.
