  Description:
    Abstract:
      The Southern California Bight (SCB; Figure I-1),an
      open embayment in the coast between
      PointConception and Cape Colnett (south of
      Ensenada),Baja California, is an important and
      uniqueecological resource.  The SCB is a
      transitionalarea that is influenced by currents
      from cold,temperate ocean waters from the north
      and warm,tropical waters from the south.  In
      addition, theSCB has a complex topography, with
      offshoreislands, submarine canyons, ridges and
      basins,which provide a variety of habitats.  The
      mixingof currents and the diverse habitats in the
      SCBallow for the coexistence of a broad spectrum
      ofspecies, including more than 500 species of
      fishand several thousand species of
      invertebrates.The SCB is also a major migration
      route, withmarine bird and mammal populations
      ranking amongthe most diverse in north temperate
      waters.  Thecoastal zone of the SCB is a
      substantial economicresource.  Los Angeles/Long
      Beach Harbor is thelargest commercial port in the
      United States, andSan Diego Harbor is home to one
      of the largest USNaval facilities in the country.
      More than 100million people visit southern
      California beachesand coastal areas annually,
      bringing an estimated$9B into the economy.
      Recreational activitiesinclude diving, swimming,
      surfing, and boating,with about 40,000 pleasure
      boats docked in 13coastal marinas within the
      region (NRC 1990).Recreational fishing brings in
      more than $500M peryear.  The SCB is one of the
      most denselypopulated coastal regions in the
      country, whichcreates stress upon its marine
      environment.Nearly 20 million people inhabit
      coastal SouthernCalifornia, a number that is
      expected to increaseanother 20% by 2010 (NRC
      1990).  Population growthgenerally results in
      conversion of open land intonon-permeable
      surfaces.  More than 75% of southernCalifornian
      bays and estuaries have already beendredged and
      filled for conversion into harbors andmarinas
      (Horn and Allen 1985).  This "hardening ofthe
      coast" increases the rate of runoff and canimpact
      water quality through addition of sediment,toxic
      chemicals, pathogens and nutrients to theocean.
      Besides the impacts of land conversion,the SCB is
      already home to fifteen municipalwastewater
      treatment facilities, eight powergenerating
      stations, 10 industrial treatmentfacilities, and
      18 oil platforms that discharge tothe open coast.
      Each year, local, state, andfederal agencies spend
      in excess of $31M tomonitor the environmental
      quality of naturalresources in the SCB (Schiff et
      al 2001).  Atleast 75% of this monitoring is
      associated withNational Pollutant Discharge
      Elimination System(NPDES) permits and is intended
      to assesscompliance of waste discharge with the
      CaliforniaOcean Plan and the federal Clean Water
      Act, whichset water quality standards for effluent
      andreceiving waters.  Some of this information
      hasplayed a significant role in management
      decisionsin the SCB.  While these monitoring
      programs haveprovided important information, they
      were designedto evaluate impacts near individual
      discharges.Today, resource managers are being
      encouraged todevelop management strategies for the
      entire SCB.To accomplish this task, they
      needregionally-based information to assess
      cumulativeimpacts of contaminant inputs and to
      evaluaterelative risk among different types of
      stresses.It is difficult to use existing data to
      evaluateregional issues because the monitoring
      wasdesigned to be site-specific and is limited
      tospecific geographic areas.  The
      monitoringprovides substantial data for some
      areas, butthere is little or no data for the areas
      inbetween.  Beyond the spatial limitations,
      datafrom these programs are not easily merged
      toexamine relative risk.  The parameters
      measuredoften differ among programs.  Even when
      the sameparameters are measured, the methodologies
      used tocollect the data often differ and
      interlaboratoryquality assurance (QA) exercises to
      assess datacomparability are rare.  Previous
      RegionalMonitoring Studies  To begin addressing
      theseconcerns, there have been two previous
      regionalmonitoring efforts.  The first regional
      monitoringsurvey in 1994, called the Southern
      CaliforniaBight Pilot Project (SCBPP), was a
      compilation of12 agencies that cooperatively
      sampled 261 sitesalong the continental shelf
      between PointConception and the United
      States/Mexico border.The second regional
      monitoring survey, called theSouthern California
      Bight 1998 Regional MonitoringProject (Bight'98),
      was comprised of 64 agenciesthat cooperatively
      sampled 416 sites between PointConception and
      Punta Banda, Mexico.  In bothsurveys, assessments
      were made of water quality,sediment contamination,
      the status of biologicalresources and species
      diversity, and the presenceof marine debris in
      depths of 10 to 200m, withsome special emphasis in
      areas of anthropogenicinputs such as large
      publicly owned treatmentworks (POTWs) or large
      river and creek mouths.However, Bight'98 extended
      what was done in 1994by adding additional habitats
      such as offshoreislands and inshore areas like
      bays/harbors, aswell as additional areas of
      anthropogenic inputssuch as marinas, ports, and
      small POTWs.Moreover, a regional evaluation of
      shoreline waterquality was added in 1998 that
      provided our firstevaluation of the swimmability
      of southernCalifornia beaches during dry and wet
      weather.Benefits derived from both the SCBPP and
      Bight'98also included the development of new
      usefultechnical tools that could only be developed
      withregional data sets and participation by
      multipleorganizations.   For example, the project
      producediron-normalization curves for the SCB,
      allowingdistinction between natural and
      anthropogeniccontributions of metals in sediments
      (Schiff andWeisberg 1998).  A Benthic Response
      Index wasdeveloped that integrates complex benthic
      infaunaldata into an easily interpreted form
      thatdescribes the degree of perturbation at a
      site(Bergen et al. 1998).  Newer,
      cheapermicrobiological methods were tested and
      evaluatedalongside traditional microbial
      measurementmethods and now have been accepted by
      both thestate health agencies for routine
      shorelinemonitoring (ref).  Bight'98 also improved
      thecomparability among the major laboratories in
      theSCB as a result of the quality assurance
      andquality control (QA/QC)
      laboratoryintercalibration exercises for chemistry
      andmicrobiology.  The project also produced a
      seriesof manuals containing standardized
      field,laboratory and data management activities
      thatincreased continuity of data and data
      reportingamong participants, even after the
      regionalmonitoring surveys were completed.  2003
      SurveyThe proposed Southern California Bight
      2003Regional Monitoring Project (Bight'03) is
      acontinuation of the successful
      cooperativeregional-scale monitoring begun in
      southernCalifornia during the 1990's.  Bight'03
      buildsupon the previous successes and expands on
      the1998 survey by including new
      participants,sampling more habitats, and measuring
      moreparameters or using new methods.
      [Number]organizations, including international
      andvolunteer organizations, have agreed
      toparticipate (Table I-1).  The inclusion
      ofmultiple participants, many of them new
      toregional monitoring, provides several
      benefits.Cooperative interactions among many
      organizationswith different perspectives and
      interests,including a combination of regulators
      anddischargers, ensures that an appropriate set
      ofregional-scale questions will be addressed by
      thestudy.  The additional resources brought
      bynumerous participants also expands the number
      ofhabitats and indicators that will be
      sampled.Sampling for Bight'03 will include all of
      theareas sampled in 1998, plus a new focus
      onnearshore habitats (coastal lagoons) and
      offshorehabitats (inner continental slopes and
      basins).Several new technologies will be brought
      to bearin Bight'03 including remote sensing
      fromsatellite, aerial, and land-based platforms,
      newmicrobial genetic and phenotypic source
      trackingtechniques, and radiodating of sediments
      todetermine age and accumulation of chemicals
      insediments.
    Purpose:
      The goal of this study was to answer two
      questions: 1) What percent of area in the SCB
      contains sediments toxic to marine organisms?; and
      2) How does sediment toxicity compare among
      specific areas of interest?  The water quality
      data file provides data on the conditions that
      existed within the test exposure containers during
      the laboratory toxicity testing of the sediments.

      htmlSediment toxicity:  Toxicity tests provide
      adirect measure of the effect of contamination
      onbenthic organisms.  These tests
      complementsediment chemistry measurements by
      providing ameasure of the combined toxic effect of
      thecomplex mixture of contaminants present
      insediment or in the water in the pores
      betweensediment grains (interstitial water).
      Sedimentsamples will be collected from the top 2
      cm of aVan Veen grab sample.  The toxicity of
      bulksediments will be assessed using an
      amphipodsurvival test conducted according to
      USEPAmethods.  Amphipods will be exposed to a 2
      cmlayer of test sediment for 10 days and
      thenexamined to determine the percent survival.
      Theamphipod Eohaustorius estuarius was selected
      forthis study because of its wide tolerance
      tovariations in habitat characteristics and
      toprovide comparability with recent
      toxicityinformation from other monitoring programs
      inCalifornia.

      Methodology_Description:
        Toxicity to amphipods was determined using a 10-d
        survival test (U.S. Environmental Protection
        Agency 1994) with Eohaustorius estuarius.
        Amphipods and negative control sediment were
        collected from Beaver Creek, Oregon, a
        non-contaminated estuarine site. The target
        laboratory holding time for the amphipods was at
        least 2 d, but no longer than 10 d, prior to the
        test. Testing was conducted in 1 L glass test
        containers. Sediment samples were presieved
        through a 2 mm mesh screen and homogenized in the
        laboratory before testing. Sediment samples were
        added to the test containers to form a sediment
        layer approximately 2 cm deep. Filtered seawater
        (20 g/kg salinity) was added slowly until a final
        volume of 800 mL was reached. Pipettes connected
        to an air source provided aeration. Sediments were
        allowed to equilibrate overnight. Each sample
        consisted of five randomly arranged replicates,
        along with two surrogate containers for water
        quality measurements of overlying water and pore
        water which were measured at time zero and at the
        end of the exposure. A negative control (amphipod
        collection site sediment) was included with each
        batch of samples tested.  At the start of the
        test, amphipods were added randomly until a total
        of 20 animals per container were present. Tests
        were conducted at 15 ± 2 °C under constant
        illumination. Test animals were exposed to the
        sediment samples for 10 d. Each test chamber was
        examined daily to verify that adequate aeration
        was present and to record observations of
        mortality or changes in sediment appearance. Any
        floating animals were submerged by gently pushing
        them beneath the surface with a probe. At the end
        of the exposure period, the sediment was screened
        through a 0.5 mm screen and the number of
        surviving amphipods was recorded.  Samples of
        overlying water and interstitial water were
        obtained from the surrogate test containers for
        measurement of initial water quality (temperature,
        pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and total
        ammonia). Overlying water quality was also
        measured at the end of the exposure period.
        Temperature of overlying water was measured daily
        throughout the test. In addition, if the unionized
        ammonia in the initial pore water measurement
        exceeded 0.8 mg/L (the concentration known to have
        an effect on amphipods), the laboratory was
        required to perform a simultaneous ammonia
        reference toxicant test with that batch.  A
        cadmium reference toxicity test was conducted
        concurrently with each sediment toxicity test
        batch. The reference toxicant test consisted of
        three replicates of five concentrations of cadmium
        dissolved in seawater, plus a control. No sediment
        was included in the reference toxicant tests. Ten
        amphipods were added to each replicate and exposed
        to the reference toxicant for 4 d. Water quality
        measurements made for the reference toxicant tests
        were conducted using a similar methodology to the
        sediment phase of the test. At the end of 4 d, the
        total number of surviving animals was recorded and
        the concentration causing 50% mortality (LC50) was
        calculated. The Trimmed Spearman Karber, probit or
        linear interpretation methods were used to
        calculate the LC50, which was then compared to a
        control chart prepared from the results of past
        reference toxicant tests conducted by the
        laboratory. A test result within two standard
        deviations of the mean control chart LC50 was
        considered acceptable.  For the data from any
        given test batch to considered acceptable, the
        mean control survival must have been greater than
        90% and no control replicate could have survival
        less than 80%. In addition, the samples had to be
        tested within four weeks of collection.
      Methodology_Type: Field
      Methodology_Description:
        Sediment samples were collected with a 0.1 m2
        modified Van Veen grab.  Up to 2.5 L of sediment
        were collected for measurement of sediment
        toxicity using the amphipod survival test.  A
        plastic (high-density polyethylene [HDPE],
        polycarbonate, or Teflon) scoop was used to
        collect sediment from the top 2 cm of the
        undisturbed surface material in the grab.  Contact
        with sediment within 1 cm of the side of the grab
        was avoided in order to minimize cross
        contamination.  The sediment was placed in clean
        HDPE containers and distributed to the testing
        laboratories.  Following collection, samples were
        stored on wet ice or refrigerated in the dark at
        4° C for no longer than four weeks prior to
        testing.
