  Description:
    Abstract:
      The Southern California Bight (SCB; Figure I-1),
      an open embayment in the coast between Point
      Conception and Cape Colnett (south of Ensenada),
      Baja California, is an important and unique
      ecological resource.  The SCB is a transitional
      area that is influenced by currents from cold,
      temperate ocean waters from the north and warm,
      tropical waters from the south.  In addition, the
      SCB has a complex topography, with offshore
      islands, submarine canyons, ridges and basins,
      which provide a variety of habitats.  The mixing
      of currents and the diverse habitats in the SCB
      allow for the coexistence of a broad spectrum of
      species, including more than 500 species of fish
      and several thousand species of invertebrates.
      The SCB is also a major migration route, with
      marine bird and mammal populations ranking among
      the most diverse in north temperate waters.  The
      coastal zone of the SCB is a substantial economic
      resource.  Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbor is the
      largest commercial port in the United States, and
      San Diego Harbor is home to one of the largest US
      Naval facilities in the country.  More than 100
      million people visit southern California beaches
      and coastal areas annually, bringing an estimated
      $9B into the economy.  Recreational activities
      include diving, swimming, surfing, and boating,
      with about 40,000 pleasure boats docked in 13
      coastal marinas within the region (NRC 1990).
      Recreational fishing brings in more than $500M per
      year.  The SCB is one of the most densely
      populated coastal regions in the country, which
      creates stress upon its marine environment.
      Nearly 20 million people inhabit coastal Southern
      California, a number that is expected to increase
      another 20% by 2010 (NRC 1990).  Population growth
      generally results in conversion of open land into
      non-permeable surfaces.  More than 75% of southern
      Californian bays and estuaries have already been
      dredged and filled for conversion into harbors and
      marinas (Horn and Allen 1985).  This “hardening of
      the coast” increases the rate of runoff and can
      impact water quality through addition of sediment,
      toxic chemicals, pathogens and nutrients to the
      ocean.  Besides the impacts of land conversion,
      the SCB is already home to fifteen municipal
      wastewater treatment facilities, eight power
      generating stations, 10 industrial treatment
      facilities, and 18 oil platforms that discharge to
      the open coast.  Each year, local, state, and
      federal agencies spend in excess of $31M to
      monitor the environmental quality of natural
      resources in the SCB (Schiff et al 2001).  At
      least 75% of this monitoring is associated with
      National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
      (NPDES) permits and is intended to assess
      compliance of waste discharge with the California
      Ocean Plan and the federal Clean Water Act, which
      set water quality standards for effluent and
      receiving waters.  Some of this information has
      played a significant role in management decisions
      in the SCB.  While these monitoring programs have
      provided important information, they were designed
      to evaluate impacts near individual discharges.
      Today, resource managers are being encouraged to
      develop management strategies for the entire SCB.
      To accomplish this task, they need
      regionally-based information to assess cumulative
      impacts of contaminant inputs and to evaluate
      relative risk among different types of stresses.
      It is difficult to use existing data to evaluate
      regional issues because the monitoring was
      designed to be site-specific and is limited to
      specific geographic areas.  The monitoring
      provides substantial data for some areas, but
      there is little or no data for the areas in
      between.  Beyond the spatial limitations, data
      from these programs are not easily merged to
      examine relative risk.  The parameters measured
      often differ among programs.  Even when the same
      parameters are measured, the methodologies used to
      collect the data often differ and interlaboratory
      quality assurance (QA) exercises to assess data
      comparability are rare.  Previous Regional
      Monitoring Studies  To begin addressing these
      concerns, there have been two previous regional
      monitoring efforts.  The first regional monitoring
      survey in 1994, called the Southern California
      Bight Pilot Project (SCBPP), was a compilation of
      12 agencies that cooperatively sampled 261 sites
      along the continental shelf between Point
      Conception and the United States/Mexico border.
      The second regional monitoring survey, called the
      Southern California Bight 1998 Regional Monitoring
      Project (Bight’98), was comprised of 64 agencies
      that cooperatively sampled 416 sites between Point
      Conception and Punta Banda, Mexico.  In both
      surveys, assessments were made of water quality,
      sediment contamination, the status of biological
      resources and species diversity, and the presence
      of marine debris in depths of 10 to 200m, with
      some special emphasis in areas of anthropogenic
      inputs such as large publicly owned treatment
      works (POTWs) or large river and creek mouths.
      However, Bight’98 extended what was done in 1994
      by adding additional habitats such as offshore
      islands and inshore areas like bays/harbors, as
      well as additional areas of anthropogenic inputs
      such as marinas, ports, and small POTWs.
      Moreover, a regional evaluation of shoreline water
      quality was added in 1998 that provided our first
      evaluation of the swimmability of southern
      California beaches during dry and wet weather.
      Benefits derived from both the SCBPP and Bight’98
      also included the development of new useful
      technical tools that could only be developed with
      regional data sets and participation by multiple
      organizations.   For example, the project produced
      iron-normalization curves for the SCB, allowing
      distinction between natural and anthropogenic
      contributions of metals in sediments (Schiff and
      Weisberg 1998).  A Benthic Response Index was
      developed that integrates complex benthic infaunal
      data into an easily interpreted form that
      describes the degree of perturbation at a site
      (Bergen et al. 1998).  Newer, cheaper
      microbiological methods were tested and evaluated
      alongside traditional microbial measurement
      methods and now have been accepted by both the
      state health agencies for routine shoreline
      monitoring (ref).  Bight’98 also improved the
      comparability among the major laboratories in the
      SCB as a result of the quality assurance and
      quality control (QA/QC) laboratory
      intercalibration exercises for chemistry and
      microbiology.  The project also produced a series
      of manuals containing standardized field,
      laboratory and data management activities that
      increased continuity of data and data reporting
      among participants, even after the regional
      monitoring surveys were completed.  2003 Survey
      The proposed Southern California Bight 2003
      Regional Monitoring Project (Bight’03) is a
      continuation of the successful cooperative
      regional-scale monitoring begun in southern
      California during the 1990’s.  Bight’03 builds
      upon the previous successes and expands on the
      1998 survey by including new participants,
      sampling more habitats, and measuring more
      parameters or using new methods.  [Number]
      organizations, including international and
      volunteer organizations, have agreed to
      participate (Table I-1).  The inclusion of
      multiple participants, many of them new to
      regional monitoring, provides several benefits.
      Cooperative interactions among many organizations
      with different perspectives and interests,
      including a combination of regulators and
      dischargers, ensures that an appropriate set of
      regional-scale questions will be addressed by the
      study.  The additional resources brought by
      numerous participants also expands the number of
      habitats and indicators that will be sampled.
      Sampling for Bight’03 will include all of the
      areas sampled in 1998, plus a new focus on
      nearshore habitats (coastal lagoons) and offshore
      habitats (inner continental slopes and basins).
      Several new technologies will be brought to bear
      in Bight’03 including remote sensing from
      satellite, aerial, and land-based platforms, new
      microbial genetic and phenotypic source tracking
      techniques, and radiodating of sediments to
      determine age and accumulation of chemicals in
      sediments.
    Purpose:
      The overall goal of the coastal ecology component
      of Bight’03 is to assess the condition of the
      bottom environment and the health of the
      biological resources in the SCB.  To accomplish
      this goal, Bight’03 will focus on two primary
      objectives:      1.Estimate the extent and
      magnitude of ecological change in the SCB,
      2.Determine the mass balance of pollutants that
      currently reside within the SCB.  The first
      objective, estimating the amount of area (i.e.,
      number of acres) in the SCB that ecological
      conditions differ from reference conditions, is a
      departure from traditional approaches to
      environmental monitoring, which generally focus on
      estimating average condition.  Estimating the
      areal extent of ecological change offers several
      advantages.  First, it provides a more direct
      assessment of status.  For instance, identifying
      that the average concentration of dissolved oxygen
      in the Bight is 6.7 ppm provides less useful
      information for environmental managers than does
      identifying what percentage of the area in the
      Bight fails to meet water quality standards.  A
      second advantage of estimating areal extent
      concerns trend detection.  If conditions in the
      Bight change over time such that some areas
      improve and others worsen, the average condition
      might not change.  By estimating the areal extent
      of alteration, we will be better able to describe
      these changes.  There are two subobjectives within
      the areal extent and magnitude objective.  The
      first subobjective is to determine if the areal
      extent and magnitude vary among geographic
      regions. If we answer this question, then managers
      can determine if specific areas are in worse
      condition than others, such as areas near
      anthropogenic inputs versus those areas distant
      from inputs.  Therefore, Bight’03 will compare
      condition among 11 geographic areas of interest
      (Table II-1).  These subpopulations of our study
      area were selected to represent a range of natural
      and potentially affected habitats, and include all
      of the habitats sampled in 1998.  There are three
      new habitats to be sampled in Bight’03.  The first
      two are located offshore of previously sampled
      habitats; the upper continental slope (200-500m)
      and the lower slope and inner basin (500-1000m).
      The break in deep water strata is a reflection of
      an ecotone between upper slope and lower slope
      biological communities.  The third habitat is
      inshore of previous sampled habitats and includes
      coastal lagoons.  Comparison of the relative
      condition among strata not only provides
      information about the geographic distribution of
      impacts, it also allows comparison of relative
      risk from a variety of point and non-point source
      discharges.  Comparison of conditions may be
      conducted by comparing the extent of area
      exceeding a threshold of concern or by comparison
      of mean condition.  The second subobjective within
      the areal extent and magnitude objective is
      assessing the relationship between biological
      responses and contaminant exposure. Such
      associations provide the information necessary for
      risk assessment, and for developing efficient
      regional strategies for protecting the environment
      by identifying the predominant types of stress in
      the SCB ecosystem.  Therefore, this subobjective
      will be accomplished by simultaneously collecting
      numerous measures of biological response,
      contaminant exposure and habitat condition (Table
      II-2) to better identify when exposure has reached
      a level of concern.  Measuring multiple indicators
      also permits us to identify the most likely type
      of exposure leading to biological response.  The
      second primary objective will create a mass
      balance of contaminants in the SCB.  This
      objective recognizes that local monitoring
      programs only address a portion of what is
      discharged to the SCB and that contaminant inputs
      to the SCB are cumulative both among sources and
      over time.  Ultimately, both environmental
      managers and the public want to know what fraction
      of the contaminants that are discharged remain in
      the SCB and what fraction leaves the SCB.
      Therefore, Bight’03 will create an inventory of
      contaminants that reside in the SCB in sediment,
      water column, and biological compartments.  The
      total mass of contaminants in these compartments
      will be compared to estimates of mass discharged
      from land based activities.  Understanding how
      much mass is in the SCB will require some new
      measurements including measurements of not just
      sediment chemistry, but estimates of accumulation
      rates in sediments, as well as new measurements in
      the water column.

    Methodology:
      Methodology_Type: Field
      Methodology_Description:
        A 0.1 m2 modified Van Veen grab will be used to
        collect sediment samples for physical, chemical,
        and infaunal analyses (Stubbs et al. 1987).  This
        device is manufactured by Kahl Scientific
        Instrument Corporation, PO Box 1166, El Cajon,
        California 92022-1166 (619/444-2158)
        kahl@kahlsico.com.  The grab may be galvanized,
        stainless steel, or Teflon-coated. All surfaces of
        the grab must be clean and free of rust.  Either
        single or tandem Van Veen grabs are acceptable.
        C.  Grab Sampling Procedures  Prior to deployment,
        the grab is cocked with the safety key in place.
        The grab is then hoisted over the side, the safety
        key is removed.  The grab is lowered at up to 2
        m/sec until it is approximately 5 m above the
        bottom,  then lowered at 1 m/sec to minimize the
        effects of bow wave disturbance of the surface
        sediment.   In water depths greater than 300 m,
        the rate of deployment may have to be reduced to
        <1 m/sec in order to avoid “kiting” of the grab
        and/or premature tripping in the water column.
        After bottom contact has been made (indicated by
        slack in the winch wire), the tension on the wire
        is slowly increased, causing the lever arms to
        close the grab.  Once the grab is back on board,
        the top doors are opened for inspection.   While a
        radius limit of 100 m (200 m for island stratum)
        has been established for site occupancy, once
        sampling has begun, the Cruise Leader will ensure
        that the vessel is maintained on station with as
        much precision as conditions allow.  Because
        analytical results from separate grab samples will
        be used to characterize the benthic community
        biointegrity, contaminant load and, in many cases,
        toxicity of the sediment, each successive grab
        must be collected as close as possible to the
        others.  D.  Priority of Grab Sampling  The
        priority of sampling at a site is 1) infauna, 2)
        sediment chemistry and grain size, and 3) sediment
        toxicity.  If it is impossible to obtain all three
        sample types at a station, those samples
        successfully collected shall be processed and
        retained.  Only those samples meeting the sample
        acceptance criteria and sample volume requirements
        (for sediment chemistry and toxicity) are
        considered to be successfully sampled.    E.
        Criteria for Acceptable Grab Samples  Site
        acceptance criteria and procedures are described
        in Section 7.  Both site and sample acceptance
        criteria are summarized as a decision tree in
        Figure 1.    Once a site has been successfully
        occupied grab sampling may still prove impossible
        or very difficult.  Different sediment types (e.g.
        cobble, gravel, well-sorted sands, etc.) and
        localities (e.g. canyons, slopes, and rocky areas)
        may be difficult to sample.  Sediments containing
        rocks often create the most common problem by
        preventing complete closure of the grab and
        allowing sediment to wash out during retrieval.
        The randomized sampling design may cause some of
        the Bight’03 sampling sites to occur on these
        difficult sediment types or localities.
        Therefore, if after three consecutive unsuccessful
        grab attempts at a site and up to three more
        consecutive unsuccessful attempts a second
        location (within the radius limit and +/-10% of
        the depth of the target site or 1 m in estuaries),
        the station should be abandoned.    If sampling
        success is intermittent, the site may be abandoned
        after a minimum of nine (9) attempts.  In this
        case, only the successfully (complete) collected
        sample types should be processed and retained.
        These are the minimum efforts justifying site
        abandonment.  Sampling failures due to operational
        error (e.g., premature tripping) do not count
        towards this minimal effort. The Cruise Leader has
        the discretion to make a greater effort if he/she
        feels that it is warranted.  The reason for site
        abandonment must be documented in the field
        computer or on the field data sheets.  Upon
        retrieval of the grab, the acceptability of the
        sample must be determined.  Acceptability is based
        upon two characteristics of the sample: sample
        condition and depth of penetration.  Sample
        condition is judged using criteria for surface
        disturbance, leakage, decanting, and washing
        (Figure 3).   FIGURE 3.  Examples of acceptable
        and unacceptable grab sample condition (from Tetra
        Tech 1986).    An acceptable sample condition is
        characterized by an even surface with minimal
        disturbance and little or no leakage of the
        overlying water.  Heavily canted samples are
        unacceptable.  Samples with a large amount of
        "humping" along the midline of the grab, which
        indicates washing of the sample during retrieval,
        are also unacceptable.  While some humping will be
        evident in samples taken from firm sediment where
        penetration has been poor, this is can be due to
        the closing action of the grab and is not
        necessarily evidence of unacceptable washing.  If
        the sample condition is acceptable, the overlying
        water is drained off and the depth of penetration
        determined by insertion of a plastic (rather than
        metal) ruler vertically along the grab midline and
        measuring to the nearest 0.5 cm.  Sediment
        penetration depth must be at least 5 cm: however,
        penetration depths of 7-10+ cm should be obtained
        in silt (fine sand to clay).  In habitats where
        sediments are unusually soft (e.g., some estuary
        muds), it may be necessary to remove the lead
        weights to prevent over-topping the grab.  Extra
        caution should be taken to drain the overlying
        water from the grabs for chemistry and toxicity
        samples.  It is recommended that a siphon be
        employed for these grabs to avoid disturbance and
        loss of the surface sediments.  The overlying
        water in grabs intended for infaunal samples may
        be drained by slightly opening the jaws of the
        grab and allowing the water to run off, as long as
        all drained water is captured for screening with
        the sediments (see Sample Processing below).  If
        both sample condition and penetration are
        acceptable in the first grab, sampling at the
        station will proceed with the collection of
        chemistry and then sediment toxicity samples from
        successive grabs.  It is required that all of the
        grabs taken at a station be of similar sediment
        type and depth penetration.    F.  Benthic
        Sampling Event Data  The Cruise Leader is
        responsible for collecting all of the required
        information associated with each station
        occupation and each grab sampling event.  A
        software application has been developed to
        facilitate the capture and entry of these data
        (Section 6).  Alternatively, paper data forms may
        be used (Appendix 6).  The required station
        occupation information includes:  •	Station ID
        •	Date •	Time of day •	Agency code •	Vessel name
        •	System used for Navigation •	Weather and sea
        conditions •	Salinity (at sites in the Estuary
        stratum) •	Station fail code (if site is
        abandoned)  The required grab event information
        includes: •	Time of day for event (when grab on
        bottom) •	Latitude and Longitude at time of event
        (when grab on bottom) •	Depth of water (when grab
        on bottom) •	Distance from station target location
        (when grab on bottom) •	Fail code (if sample fails
        to meet sample acceptance criteria, see Field
        Sheets or Information Management Plan for codes)
        •	Penetration •	Sediment composition (type)
        •	Sediment odor •	Sediment color •	Presence of
        shell hash •	Sample types produced from sediment
        grab  G.  Sediment Description  The field
        dscription of sediments is required following
        measurement of penetration depth. The sediment
        should be characterized as being coarse sand, fine
        sand, silt or clay, gravel, or of a mixed type.
        The presence of petroleum tar and shell hash
        should also be recorded. Obvious odors, such as
        hydrogen sulfide (the odor of rotten eggs),
        petroleum, other odors, or a lack of noticeable
        odors should be recorded.  General sediment colors
        (i.e., black, green, brown, red, olive, or gray)
        should also be recorded.  H.  Sample Processing
        Benthic Infaunal Samples  After the sample
        dscription has been completed, the sediment
        sample intended for biological analysis is washed
        from the grab and screened.  Raw water used to
        wash the samples is to be filtered in some fashion
        to prevent the accidental introduction of
        surface-water organisms.  Thoroughly wash the
        sediment from the grab and transfer it to a
        sediment-washing table for screening.   In the
        estuary stratum, the necessity of sampling from
        small craft may not permit onboard screening of
        the sediment.  In these cases the samples may be
        screened and processed on land at a screening
        station temporarily established near the sampling
        location.  To assure that the sample does not
        deteriorate, such “off-site” screening must be
        completed as soon as possible and no longer than
        90 minutes after sample collection.  A means of
        capturing all water drained from the grab, the
        grab sample, and the wash water must be used.
        Typically, a tub (>70 L capacity) is positioned
        under the grab.  The use of a sediment-washing
        table is recommended, but not required.  The table
        is useful in that provides a flat, smooth surface
        over which to spread and wash the sample, thereby
        providing a means of gently breaking up the
        sediment before it runs off the end of the table
        into the screen box.  The screening box must be
        equipped with a stainless steel mesh with 1.0-mm
        openings.  Wire diameter should be similar to that
        found in the U.S. Standard 1.00 mm Sieve (i.e.,
        0.58 mm).  The surface area of the screen should
        be adequate to easily accept the sample without
        build up.  Typical surface areas used in surveys
        in the Bight are 1500 to 2100 cm2.  While washing
        the sample, control the water pressure to avoid
        damaging the organisms.  Minimize direct
        application of water from the hose to the material
        and organisms collecting on the screen.  Once the
        sample has been washed through the screen,
        transfer the material (debris, coarse sediment,
        and organisms) retained on the screen to a sample
        container.  Label the sample container with an
        external label containing the sampling agency
        name, station name, sample type, date, and "split
        number" (i.e. 1 of 1, 2 of 3, etc.) if required.
        An internal label bearing the same information is
        placed inside the infaunal samples.  This label
        can be written in pencil or indelible ink on 100%
        rag paper, poly-paper, or other paper of a quality
        suitable for wet labels.  The sample container
        must have a screw-cap closure and be sufficiently
        large to accommodate the sample material with a
        head-space of at least 30% of the container
        volume.  A sample may be split between two or more
        containers.  However, each container must have
        external and internal labels (as described above)
        with the appropriate "split number" clearly
        marked.  Field crews should have a broad range of
        sample container sizes available to them, with
        none less than 16 oz (0.47 L) capacity.  Gently
        remove the material retained on the screen, taking
        care to avoid damaging the organisms.  The sample
        container should be filled to approximately 50 to
        70% of capacity with screened material.  After the
        bulk of material has been transferred to the
        container, closely examine the screen for any
        organisms caught in the mesh.  Remove any
        organisms with forceps and add them to the sample
        container.  Thoroughly wash the screen box and
        scrub the mesh before the next sample is screened.
        All infaunal samples will be treated with a
        relaxant solution for approximately 30 minutes
        prior to fixation.  Either an Epsom salts (MgSO4)
        solution or a propylene phenoxytol solution
        (formulations below) may be used for this purpose.
        Relaxant solutions may be used as the diluent
        water for the fixative, or may be decanted after
        exposure and replaced with diluted fixative.  If
        it is used as diluent water, fill the sample
        container to 85 to 90% of its volume, close the
        container and invert it several times to
        distribute the solution.  Leave the sample in the
        relaxant for 30 minutes.  After 30 minutes, top
        off the container with enough sodium borate
        buffered formaldehyde to achieve a 10% formalin
        solution.  Close the container, once again, and
        invert it several times to assure mixing.  Store
        the sample for return to the laboratory.  If the
        relaxant solution is not used as the diluent
        water, the relaxant must be removed from the
        sample container and replaced with 10% buffered
        formalin.  After the 30 minutes of treatment,
        decant the relaxant from the sample through a
        screen with a mesh size of 1.0 mm or less.  Insure
        that all animals are removed from the screen and
        placed in the sample container.  Fill the
        container with sodium borate buffered 10% formalin
        rather than undiluted formaldehyde, then close the
        container, invert it several times and store it
        for return to the laboratory.  Relaxant and
        fixative stock solution alternatives are as
        follows: 1)	Epsom salts relaxant solution:	1.5 kg
        Epsom salts (MgSO4 @ 7H2O) per 20 L of freshwater.
        2)	Propylene phenoxytol solution:  	30 ml
        propylene phenoxytol to 20 L of seawater.
        3)	Buffered formalin solution:	   	50 g sodium
        borate (Na2B4O7) per liter of formalin.
        4)	Buffered 10% formalin solution:  	1 part
        buffered formalin to 9 parts fresh or salt water.
        At the end of the sampling day the samples will be
        returned to the laboratory and stored in fixative
        for no less than 72 hours.  Within two weeks of
        collection they will then be washed and
        transferred to preservative according to the
        procedures described in section 1 of the Bight’03
        Macrobenthic (Infaunal) Sample Analysis Laboratory
        Manual (2003).     If the samples will be analyzed
        by other laboratories, they will be transported
        (in preservative) to SCCWRP for later
        distribution.  It is recommended that SCCWRP
        (Darrin Greenstein, 714/372-9224) be contacted
        prior to delivery of samples so that arrangements
        can be made to transfer custody.  A completed
        chain of custody form must accompany all shipments
        of samples (Appendix 6).  Allow time for
        verification of the chain of custody.
